		Hello, I am Izaque, Stake2, and Funkysnipa Cat.<br />
This is SpaceLiving, a story of mine, I created it on "19/01/2019" (DD/MM/YYYY) with a friend of mine, Júlia.<br />
She is or was a spirit that existed in my house, I talked with her through psychography, a way to listen to the spirit's voices in your head.<br />
And she gave me the idea for the story, she talked about Lisa, living somewhere in space, in her room.<br />
I perfected the story, made it better, and created the idea of the spaceship, and other people living inside spaceships too.<br />
And also about the spaceship network, and the systems of the spaceship, just like I do with my theory and story, New World.<br />
I also create systems and technologies for the New World theory and write about them in the story.<br />
New World is a theory about a better world than this one, with no hunger, thirst, discrimination, pain, or death.<br />
The universe of SpaceLiving is the same as the New World one.<br />
SpaceLiving also takes inspiration from the "Shelter" video made by Porter Robinson, Madeon, A-1 Pictures, and Crunchyroll.<br />
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzQ6gRAEoy0" target="_blank">"Porter Robinson & Madeon - Shelter (Official Video) (Short Film with A-1 Pictures & Crunchyroll)"</a><br />
<br />
Taken from the video:<br />
"Shelter tells the story of Rin, a 17-year-old girl who lives her life inside of a futuristic simulation completely by herself in infinite, beautiful loneliness.<br />
Each day, Rin awakens in virtual reality and uses a tablet that controls the simulation to create a new, different, beautiful world for herself.<br />
Until one day, everything changes, and Rin comes to learn the true origins behind her life inside a simulation."<br />
<br />
Lisa is a little like that, a girl trapped inside a spaceship, where she can not leave and has everything she needs, food, entertainment, and other things.<br />
This thing about her not being able to leave the spaceship changed a little after some chapters.<br />
She can also modify her surroundings, the spaceship is modular, and can create things that Lisa wants, with a system called "Things Generator".<br />
I have been writing this story for some years already, since 2019, I am revising it again in 2023.<br />
I also revised all of its chapters and perfected the story a lot before this year.<br />
And I am ready to share this story with you, I love it a lot, and I also wanted to live inside a LonelyShip, which is the type of spaceship the characters live in.<br />
I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed writing it.<br />
<br />
In the year 2019, there was a rumor of some spaceships that had an entire house inside them, those spaceships were called the LonelyShips.<br />
Some rumors about those spaceships were spreading across the Internet, people were talking about them on the Internet forums and making theories.<br />
The company that created those spaceships and the "SpaceLiving Network" was called "Think Outside The Box" or TOTB for short, formerly "SpaceLiving Inc."<br />
In the beginning, the "Think Outside The Box" (TOTB) company was only an informal New World Company.<br />
The "SpaceLiving Creator Izaque" who created the network, was a New World Izaque from one of the neighboring universes of the origin universe, where Creator Izaque lived.<br />
He created a beta version of the "SpaceLiving Inc." New World company, creating the LonelyShips inside his universe.<br />
After the network gained some members or residents, SpaceLiving Creator Izaque installed a second instance of the network in another universe.<br />
He installed the instance in an Old World universe and made a clone of himself to manage the SpaceLiving Network there.<br />
The SpaceLiving Creator Izaque invited the Old World Izaque of that universe to live inside the network while he was sleeping.<br />
That Old World Izaque is called the "SpaceLiving Izaque", and he will write the "SpaceLiving" story and thus, create the "SpaceLiving" literature universe.<br />
SpaceLiving Creator Izaque was happy to create the network, to help sad and depressed teens live a better life than on Earth.<br />
Creator Izaque, the creator of the New World, also participated in the beta version, which happened on day eighteen, August 2016 (18/08/2016).<br />
The Creator Izaque asked the SpaceLiving Creator Izaque, to install the third instance of the SpaceLiving Network in his universe, for him to manage it.<br />
And also to have a LonelyShip there for him to live inside it, and be happy.<br />
The MotherShip had various systems and holograms for SpaceLiving Creator Izaque to manage the network.<br />
Like logs and registries of things that happen on the network, like new LonelyShips being made.<br />
And the profile of the LonelyShippers, who are the residents of the network.<br />
SpaceLiving Creator Izaque also created a server in the "Discord" social media platform called the "SpaceLiving Server".<br />
There would be a place for residents to talk with each other and ask questions for Izaque.<br />
And also to read the story of the network, tutorials, tips, and curiosities about it too.<br />
Izaque also created the "SpaceLiving Helper" form for people to volunteer as helpers.<br />
They would answer questions in the help and questions chat and would help people who talked about their problems and vented in the vent chat.<br />
<br />
Creator Izaque created the "New World Companies System" (NWCS) on day twenty, January 2019 (20/01/2019).<br />
SpaceLiving Creator Izaque then used that system to formalize his New World company, renaming it to "Think Outside The Box" (Formerly: SpaceLiving Inc.), on day twenty-one, January 2019 (21/01/2019).<br />
The Soft and Blue Waves created by the "New World Ambassador" or "Izaque Help" programs also installed new instances of the "SpaceLiving Network" inside the universes they reached.<br />
And the Izaque of each universe was invited to be the manager of the respective SpaceLiving Network, be it an Old or New World Izaque.<br />
New World Izaques would have the job of managing the New World and also managing the SpaceLiving Networks.<br />
But they could handle that because they could create clones of themselves.<br />
Old World Izaques would have the only job of managing the SpaceLiving Networks.<br />
But they could install New World using the "New World Installation Devices" (NWIDs) they received, and be Managers of New World too.<br />
The First SpaceLiving Anniversary will happen to every instance of the SpaceLiving Network, in every universe where the network exists, with a different PartyShip.<br />
The Manager Izaques, the Izaques that manage the SpaceLiving Networks, start with empty networks without LonelyShips.<br />
These networks only contain the MotherShip, the "Floating Spacecraft Factory" (FSF), and the personal LonelyShip of the manager.<br />
The invitation and initiation processes and systems worked autonomously, so the managers could focus on improving the network and the systems of the LonelyShips.<br />
After the "TOTB" was formalized, SpaceLiving Creator Izaque made an update to all of the SpaceLiving Networks.<br />
He updated the "Windows 10 (SpaceLiving Edition)" operational system of the computers of the LonelyShips.<br />
The boy also renamed the AI of the spaceships to "LonelyShip Artificial Intelligence" (LSAI).<br />
He updated the "Things Generator" and "Food Generator" systems, and the "Thought-Powered Fridge" (TPF) to improve them.<br />
Izaque also created the new "LonelyShip Teleporter" (LST).<br />
It could teleport the residents between other spaceships and also to Earth.<br />
<br />
The LonelyShips had a super fast and powerful computer on each one of them, it was white, a PlayStation 4 gaming console, a bed, and a wardrobe.<br />
The computers had a modified version of Windows 10 installed on them.<br />
It was called Windows 10 (SpaceLiving Edition).<br />
<br /><img class="image_size border_4px border_color_cyan border_radius_8_cent box_shadow_black" src="https://thestake2.netlify.app/Images/Images/SpaceLiving/LonelyShip Story Cover.png" style="max-width: 50%;" /><br /><br />
The bed had a blue blanket, the bed was made of some resistant plastic that was light gray, and the wardrobe was gray too.<br />
The spaceships also had a Laser Turret outside of them, it could shoot a laser beam to hit approaching asteroids.<br />
The Laser Turret had two modes, the Expanded Range mode, and the Shielded mode.<br />
The Expanded Range mode made it possible for the Laser Turret to shoot asteroids that were in a place that was hard to aim.<br />
The Shielded mode made it possible for the Laser Turret to cover itself with a shield to protect it from asteroids.<br />
Two tall windows to see the sun, the moon, and the Earth, an ergonomic chair with casters, adjustable armrests, height, and back.<br />
The spaceship had also a bathroom, and sixteen turbines to move the spaceship when needed, they were deactivated by default.<br />
The LonelyShip could compress the bathroom to a small place.<br />
Making it possible to the resident of the LonelyShip to open the door of the bathroom and enter inside it, without making the spaceship too large.<br />
The bathroom existed in a type of space that did not occupy physical space, it was the width of the door.<br />
Also, the spaceship had a teleporter that could teleport the resident of the spaceship between other spaceships and also to Earth.<br />
The teleporter was called "LonelyShip Teleporter", the initials were LST and were written on the upper part of its plastic frame, it was blue.<br />
That teleporter did not exist in older versions of the LonelyShip, in the beta version that the creator did to test the systems.<br />
That beta version was created and tested on day eighteen, August 2016 (18/08/2016).<br />
The wardrobe of the spaceship had four doors and was on the right of the LST teleporter.<br />
There was also a fridge that could create anything you thought of, it was called a "Thought-Powered Fridge" or TPF, and was blue.<br />
It was on the left of the computer chair, and at the right of the left window.<br />
The fridge made foods and drinks that were only nutrients, for example, a slice of pizza.<br />
That slice of pizza would have the smell, taste, and texture of a pizza, but would be just nutrients and vitamins that the resident needed.<br />
The TPF fridge would analyze the body of the resident and make a diet containing the nutrients and vitamins that the resident needs.<br />
Then it would split those nutrients that were needed for the whole day into three meals: breakfast, lunch, and dinner.<br />
If the resident wanted to eat more than three meals, the fourth and next meals would be only mass, not nutrients, so that the resident would not be hungry for three hours.<br />
The resident of the spaceship could also have more than three meals with nutrients, it could select the exact number of meals with nutrients on the day.<br />
Food created by the TPF fridge did not have meat or animal products, they were vegan.<br />
The fridge contained a system called "Things Generator" inside it, that contained the atomic recipe of all things that exist in the universe, even air.<br />
It was a modified version of this system to generate only food, nicknamed "Food Generator".<br />
The food created by the fridge were microorganisms that could generate nutrients inside themselves, and also modify their taste, smell, texture, and appearance.<br />
If you thought of a slice of pizza and opened the fridge, a plate with a lot of microorganisms would appear there.<br />
With the appearance, smell, texture, and taste of a pizza, and the nutrients you need.<br />
If you had a visitor on your spaceship, and you gave a plate with pizza to them, the microorganisms would generate and contain the nutrients that the visitor needs.<br />
The spaceship or LonelyShip had Artificial Intelligence, an AI, that could help the residents of the spaceships manage their spaceships.<br />
The AI was called "LonelyShip Artificial Intelligence", or LSAI for short.<br />
The LonelyShip also had four small signboards on its walls, two displaying "SpaceLiving", and another two displaying "LonelyShip" on the right of the "SpaceLiving" one.<br />
The "SpaceLiving" and "LonelyShip" signboards were equal on each side of the LonelyShip, one of each on each side of the inside walls of the spaceship.<br />
The signboards on the left side were on the left of the left window, and the right ones were on the right of the right window.<br />
Also, the LonelyShip had two big signboards on the front side of it, one with "SpaceLiving" written on it, and another one with "LonelyShip".<br />
The "SpaceLiving" signboard is above the "LonelyShip" one.<br />
<br /><img class="image_size border_4px border_color_cyan border_radius_8_cent box_shadow_black" src="https://thestake2.netlify.app/Images/Images/SpaceLiving/LonelyShip Story Cover Front Signboards.png" style="max-width: 50%;" /><br /><br />
<br />
That spaceship, the LonelyShip, was part of a network of spaceships, the network was called "SpaceLiving Network".<br />
A lot of other people lived inside those spaceships, the spaceships were not close enough for you to see one outside your window.<br />
A company created that network for teens that were depressed and sad about their lives, they did not have a will or a purpose to live for.<br />
The company teleported the depressed teens to the LonelyShips while they were sleeping.<br />
They were teleported to their LonelyShip, and they thought that it was a dream, then, the LonelyShip Artificial Intelligence (LSAI) told them that they were not in a dream.<br />
After that, the teens asked if they could go back to Earth, and the LSAI said they could.<br />
The computers of the LonelyShips also had the SpaceLiving App installed by default, for those who did not like to manage their LonelyShips with an AI.<br />
The residents of the SpaceLiving Network were called LonelyShippers.<br />
They also asked what they could do there, and the LSAI explained to them.<br />
If you live in a LonelyShip, you can ask the LSAI for anything, like changing wall colors, or removing, or adding furniture.<br />
The "Things Generator", a system that exists inside the LonelyShip, which is also the base for the "Food Generator", will create those things for you.<br />
It can also remove things that you do not want in your spaceship.<br />
This system is responsible for creating the plates, silverware, cups, and bowls used in the TPF fridge, and also removing them when you store them inside the fridge.<br />
Some of the teens decided to stay there, and live a better life inside the SpaceLiving Network, they thought they would have fun there.<br />
Using the computer, playing games, listening to music, watching anime, cartoons, series, movies, and videos, and doing creative things like art and programming.<br />
Some of them thought that it was bad to have to eat food, drink water, and sleep, they still needed to do that, but now they could do it a lot easier.<br />
The TOTB company thought that they would live a better life on their spaceships.<br />
<br />
One of those people is Lisa, a sixteen years old girl (2019), she is a girl from the United States, but her parents were born in Brazil.<br />
They traveled to the United States before having their kids.<br />
Lisa had medium gray hair and green eyes, she played games on her computer and used the TPF fridge to eat.<br />
The girl also liked to write stories on her computer, Lisa posted them on the Wattpad website for the world to see.<br />
(Wattpad is a website for people to write and read stories, and for authors to post their stories and gain readers.)<br />
The girl lived her life there, doing the stuff that she loved to do, the things that made her happy, and the things that had meaning to her.<br />
Lisa had a beautiful LonelyShip with blue walls, it had a super-fast computer with two screens, a PlayStation 4 video game console, and a TPF fridge.<br />
The spaceship also had a bathroom with a laser toilet bowl that melts the things inside it, a double-size bed, a wardrobe, and a portable video game console called Nintendo 3DS.<br />
Lisa had the normal things that every LonelyShip has, and the Nintendo 3DS which was gotten from the item library of the LonelyShip, inside the SpaceLiving App.<br />
She asked for the LSAI to change her wall colors, she asked for a blue color.<br />
The walls of the LonelyShip were made of a special material that could change its color while in contact with some specific substances.<br />
She has asked the LSAI to change its name, the default name of the LSAI is "Isabella", and its default gender is female.<br />
Some people theorize on the Internet that Isabella was someone very important to the creator of TOTB.<br />
So he gave this name to the LSAI, to honor her.<br />
Lisa gave the name Ana to the LSAI, it was the name of her mother, for Lisa to remind of her.<br />
The girl thought about her father, he was named John, she loved her father, but thought he did not like her.<br />
She liked to use her computer because it was super fast and had lots of hard drive space for her to download and store her series, anime, cartoons, and movies.<br />
Lisa loved to live there, write stories, play games, and listen to some Dubstep and Japanese songs on her computer.<br />
Today she had nothing important to do, but she wanted to play some games on the Steam gaming platform.<br />
(Steam is software where you can download free and paid games to play on your computer.)<br />
Lisa turned her computer on and sat on the chair, clicked on the Steam shortcut, and waited for it to open.<br />
The chair that she had was very comfortable, it was like a gaming chair, it had adjustable things and a backrest lever to tilt back and relax.<br />
She opened a game called "Titanfall 2" to play a little, she loved that game, it had lots of futuristic things and mechas, robots, and laser weapons.<br />
Lisa entered a multiplayer match and made a 10/3 (ten slash three) score, 10 are the kills and 3 are the deaths.<br />
She liked that match, then she closed Steam and opened the programs Mozilla Firefox and Spotify.<br />
(Mozilla Firefox is a web browser, and Spotify is a music player where you can listen to online music without downloading it.)<br />
Lisa put to play a Dubstep playlist on Spotify, to blast on her speakers, and started banging her head to the beat of the song.<br />
She liked the fact that she could hear music at full volume and no one would hear and be annoyed.<br />
(Because in space, no one can hear you scream, just kidding, hehe. ^^)<br />
<br />
Then she opened a social network website called Facebook to talk with her friends and started to talk with one friend of hers called Anny, she lived on Earth and was not a LonelyShipper.<br />
(Facebook is a social network where you can create an account and make a profile with information about you, it can be used to talk and make friends online.)<br />
"What's up?" asked Lisa.<br />
"I'm fine, how about you?" asked Anny.<br />
"Me too, what are you up to?" asked Lisa.<br />
"Just playing some God of War on my PS4, what about you, Lisa?" asked Anny with a smile emoji.<br />
"Oh, that's cool, I'm just listening to some Dubstep," replied Lisa.<br />
"That sounds great, what song are you listening to?" asked Anny.<br />
"The song is called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WYMQbWUxGM" target="_blank">"'Still Got Something' from God's Warrior"</a>," replied Lisa.<br />
"I'll listen to it after I finish playing, can you send it to me?" asked Anny.<br />
Lisa then sent the Spotify link to the song to Anny.<br />
"I'm gonna do something else now, good game for you, see you later ^^," said the gray-haired girl.<br />
"See you Lisa ^^, thanks for the link, hehe," replied Anny.<br />
"You're welcome, hehe," said Lisa.<br />
<br />
Lisa closed Mozilla Firefox, turned her PlayStation 4 on, and grabbed its controller, the PS4 was connected to a second screen that Lisa had.<br />
She set the PS4 screen on her center screen, she only used her right screen to put something she was not going to look at often, doing the opposite would hurt her neck.<br />
The girl also opened her favorite music player on her computer which was called Foobar2000 and closed Spotify.<br />
She had lots of gigabytes of music stored in her solid-state drive (SSD), and Lisa liked to have such a big library of music.<br />
The girl had five solid-state drives (SSDs) on her computer, she could see each one of them using the file explorer of her computer.<br />
Each one of them had 10 TB (Terabytes) of space, she had one for music, one for games, one for the modified version of Windows 10, one for her general files, and one for media, movies, cartoons, anime, and series.<br />
Then Lisa opened the game called "Grand Theft Auto V" on the PS4 and started playing, she was playing the online mode of that game.<br />
Lisa thought about when she played GTA 5 on her computer, it ran clean and fast, without lagging.<br />
She liked to have such a powerful computer with a good graphics card, a fast SSD, and a fast CPU, the AMD Ryzen™ Threadripper™ with sixty-four cores and one hundred twenty-eight threads.<br />
The CPU (Central Processing Unit) worked with a base clock at 2.9GHz, but Lisa's was overclocked, it worked at a 4.3GHz clock.<br />
The girl was playing with her friends, and she was listening to the Dubstep song called "Geoxor - Turn Around" on the Foobar2000 music player.<br />
She liked that song and sang a little bit while listening to the sound of the Dubstep basses, she was happy playing and listening to music.<br />
The girl felt that she was a little hungry, she became AFK (Away From Keyboard) in the game and laid her controller on the desk.<br />
She got up and opened her TPF fridge, it was an automatic fridge that created any food that the person thought of, it had the "Food Generator" system inside it.<br />
You could think of a pizza and a pizza would appear instantly inside the fridge.<br />
Then Lisa grabbed the cup of chocolate milk and the hamburger that was inside the fridge, she sat at her desk and started eating the hamburger and drinking the milk.<br />
While she ate, she looked at the screen, she was inside the car of her friends, seeing them drive to a place to do a bank heist mission.<br />
After eating, she registered the time that she ate in a text file, turned on a stopwatch to know when she could drink water, and stored the cup inside the fridge.<br />
Lisa continued playing, she played for some minutes, then Lisa told her friends that she was going to do something else.<br />
The girl closed the "Grand Theft Auto V" game and turned her PS4 off, storing the controller in a drawer of the computer table.<br />
She put to play a live stream of songs of the "Future Bass" genre on the Twitch website and rested a little while laying in her bed.<br />
(Twitch is a website where you can watch live streams, the majority of them are of gaming, but there is also chat, instruments, song live streams, trips, and react.)<br />
The girl had over-ear wireless headphones, they were good for sound isolation and had a good sound stage and acoustics.<br />
Lisa did not need the sound isolation or noise-canceling feature as there were no sounds in her LonelyShip, only hers.<br />
<br />
Lisa also liked to watch movies, series, anime, cartoons, and YouTube videos.<br />
She liked to download them with a program called Utorrent and another one called Mega.<br />
The girl liked to download HD, Full HD, 60 FPS, and 4K videos from YouTube with a program called 4K Video Downloader.<br />
After resting a little, Lisa thought about watching a movie, she got up and closed the live stream of the "Future Bass" music genre.<br />
She liked Marvel and its movies, she had downloaded a movie called "Avengers: Infinity War" from Marvel which launched in 2018, and she stored it on her media SSD.<br />
Lisa grabbed a purple plastic bowl filled with Doritos and a bottle of Coca-cola from inside the TPF fridge to eat and drink while watching the movie.<br />
Then the girl opened her video player called "VLC Media Player" and opened the video file of "Avengers: Infinity War" with it.<br />
The gray-haired girl watched the movie while eating, making some pauses to go to the bathroom.<br />
Lisa commented on some parts of the movie on a text file, she typed the time of the movie, like "01:15:35", and typed what she thought, or how she felt.<br />
She even opened the "Discord" program on her computer to talk about the movie with her friends.<br />
(Discord is a social network platform for gamers but non-gamers also use it.)<br />
The girl loved the movie, all the action, the heroes, and the special effects, but she was sad about Spider-Man.<br />
Lisa also wrote on the text file everything that she thought about the movie, her feelings, and her opinions.<br />
Then she saved the file and closed it, after that, she opened an episode of the "The Walking Dead" series to watch.<br />
The girl watched the entire episode while eating the rest of her Doritos and drinking the rest of her Coca-cola bottle.<br />
Lisa liked that series, she watched it when she was younger, and it brings back good memories, even if it is a little violent and scary.<br />
The series reminded her of a special someone, of the time she watched that series with her older brother when Lisa lived on Earth.<br />
She did not clearly remember how he was, what he looked like, or what his name was.<br />
It has been some time since she saw him, it was since she had bad grades and thought her life was bad.<br />
It was at that moment when Lisa got teleported to her LonelyShip, after sleeping.<br />
After she started living on her LonelyShip, she started forgetting about her family, her brother.<br />
<br />
Then she opened another live stream of the "Future Bass" music genre, but now on YouTube.<br />
After some time drinking water and listening to Future Bass music, she got tired and said good night to her friends on Discord.<br />
Then she turned her computer off, used the bathroom, and said good night to Ana, her LSAI.<br />
Ana said goodnight back and turned the LonelyShip lights off for Lisa to sleep, she could only look through the windows to see some light.<br />
The LSAI, Ana, turned the turbines of the spaceship on and left the LonelyShip spinning slowly, so Lisa could see the Earth, moon, and sun sometimes through the windows.<br />
Her body was tired, Lisa lay in her bed and closed her eyes, she had a dream where she was going to school, had to clean her room, and had to get high grades.<br />
For her that dream was a nightmare, she did not like that style of life and did not like to do the hard stuff.<br />
Then, after a while, that dream disappeared and another dream took its place, a better dream.<br />
Lisa was dreaming of using her supercomputer, listening to Dubstep songs, and talking to her friends on Discord.<br />
She liked that dream, she was happy and wanted to wake up just to do the same thing that she was doing in the dream.<br />
Lisa loved the life she lived, she had a spaceship that had a bed, a wardrobe, the TPF fridge, a supercomputer, a PlayStation 4, Nintendo 3DS, and a Laser Turret.<br />
The girl had a lot of things to make her happy and entertain her, to make her feel complete, and to make her life feel worthwhile.<br />
Lisa wanted to play games, watch, write, listen, draw, talk, create, explore the world of the Internet, experience things, to feel things.<br />
She wanted to live alone inside her spaceship, inside her LonelyShip, she wanted to do a lot of fun things, to eat delicious food and drink delicious drinks.<br />
And this is the story of her life, it is also the story of the "SpaceLiving Network", the network of spaceships that make you happy, "SpaceLiving" means living in space.<br />
Those SpaceShips are called LonelyShips by TOTB because they are lonely, there is only you inside of it, you and the things you like.<br />

		(The Fred in this chapter is the SpaceLiving version of Fred of my story called <a class="text_light_brown" href="https://thestake2.netlify.app/The Story of the Bulkan Siblings/en/" target="_blank">"The Story of the Bulkan Siblings"</a>.<br />
But he lives in a universe where the "SpaceLiving SpaceShip Network" exists and is younger.<br />
<a href="https://thestake2.netlify.app/The%20Story%20of%20the%20Bulkan%20Siblings/en/" target="_blank" class="text_green_water text_hover_green_water">https://thestake2.netlify.app/The%20Story%20of%20the%20Bulkan%20Siblings/en/</a>)<br />
<br />
Still in the year 2019, there was a tale about super innovative spaceships where you had a lot of things to do.<br />
Those spaceships were called LonelyShips because you were lonely there, there was only you there.<br />
An official Discord server existed for the SpaceLiving Network, it was called "SpaceLiving Discord Server".<br />
The server was created by TOTB (Think Outside The Box), the creators of the SpaceLiving Network.<br />
(Discord is a social network platform for gamers but non-gamers also use it.)<br />
A Discord server is like a group where you can spend time, you can create channels for different categories or topics of messages and posts.<br />
A gaming company could create a server to post announcements of updates to the game, and also for players to report errors in the game.<br />
There were lots of people that lived in the LonelyShips, they created communities.<br />
The residents of those spaceships created a lot of unofficial Discord servers to communicate and talk about being a LonelyShipper.<br />
Being a LonelyShipper is being a resident of one of the LonelyShips of the "SpaceLiving SpaceShip Network".<br />
The members of the community theorized about where the TOTB (Think Outside The Box) company resided, who were its creators, and how they built the LonelyShips.<br />
How did they build this incredible technology, that could remove stuff from the spaceship, and generate food and other things with the Food and Things Generators?<br />
It was like a social or digital movement, just like the Bronies, Furries, and 4channers were some years ago.<br />
These three movements are still active, but they are not as famous as before.<br />
The LonelyShippers liked to be in the LonelyShipper movement, but Lisa, our main character, did not participate in that.<br />
She was just her, spending time at her computer, without a social movement or stereotype to stick to.<br />
The girl liked to be a LonelyShipper, she liked the opportunity that TOTB gave to teens, to live happier in their LonelyShips.<br />
She liked the status of being a LonelyShipper but did not talk too much in the SpaceLiving Discord Server.<br />
Lisa was just there to check the news and announcements about the network that TOTB posted.<br />
The desktop app of Discord came installed by default on Windows 10 (SpaceLiving Edition), on the computer of the resident.<br />
Every resident of the SpaceLiving Network was encouraged to create a Discord account, including Lisa.<br />
Think Outside The Box did that to help sad teens overcome depression and social phobia.<br />
On the official Discord server, the residents had people like them to talk and vent to, be it by text or video call.<br />
There were also venting text channels and text channels for residents to talk about their problems and seek help.<br />
<br />
There was also a boy named Fred that lived in a LonelyShip, he had seventeen years old and was a LonelyShipper.<br />
The boy liked to play games on the Steam digital gaming platform.<br />
(Steam is software where you can download free and paid games to play on your computer.)<br />
He was also on the official Discord server of the SpaceLiving Network.<br />
The boy talked in the general chat channel and read the announcements on the updates channel.<br />
Fred liked to play a lot of games, he was very competitive at them and did not like to lose.<br />
He was at his LonelyShip and did not know what time it was on Earth, but he could choose which time zone his computer's clock would have.<br />
Fred only wanted to play games and was thinking about some things while being laid on his bed.<br />
"Why I'm in this bed? I was alone some years ago and wanted to stay away from the others.<br />
Because they made me angry, I was suffering because of them... And they annoyed me too.<br />
Also, I feel that I was someone in another place or an alternate universe.<br />
Like I was some kind of hero or teacher of martial arts and I was teaching martial arts to some friends.<br />
I should stop thinking about that, maybe I'm too tired or something, I should get back to the computer," thought him, looking at the ceiling.<br />
Then Fred got out of his bed and turned the computer on, he opened Steam to play some games.<br />
Fred had a friend called Mark, Fred felt that they were friends in an alternate universe.<br />
Fred opened the game Apex Legends to play, it was a new game that EA launched and was a Battle Royale game, Fred wanted to test it.<br />
(A Battle Royale game is a game where there is a set number of players on a map, like one hundred, and they have to fight to see who lasts, the last one alive wins the match.)<br />
He played for a few minutes and liked it, Fred was very good at the game and had made many kills.<br />
Then he closed the game and called his friend Mark on Discord to play some Overwatch.<br />
They played a little while talking using the voice-call feature of Discord, Mark also lived in a LonelyShip.<br />
Mark and Fred were very good friends, they were friends on Earth too, virtual friends, before being teleported to a LonelyShip.<br />
They read about the rumor of the LonelyShips on the Internet one time, they thought it would be awesome to live there, to have a powerful computer for free.<br />
Then, some time passed, and the two were sleeping, it was night, and they dreamed about the LonelyShip and the SpaceLiving Network.<br />
Each one of Fred and Mark was teleported to a LonelyShip, they passed through the LonelyShip initiation, asked if they could go back, and asked what they could do there.<br />
The LSAI Isabella guided them through the process, they decided to stay, the LSAI knows a lot about feelings and humans.<br />
She could know that Fred had a friend, Isabella told Fred that this friend was also in a LonelyShip.<br />
"Really?" asked Fred, "Yes," replied Isabella.<br />
Then Fred logged in to his Discord account, he talked to Mark, they were so happy talking to each other.<br />
Telling that they both got into a LonelyShip.<br />
"Yooo dude, I'm in a LonelyShip dude," said Mark in a text message.<br />
"Yeah, hehe, so awesome, now we can play a lot of games together dude!" replied Fred.<br />
<br />
Now, Back To The (Future) present, after some time playing, Fred won some matches and wanted to close the game.<br />
"Hey, I'm gonna go do something else man, see you later," said Fred in a text message on Discord to Mark.<br />
"Oh, okay man, see you later, bye," replied Mark.<br />
Fred liked to read some stories on the Internet on a website called Wattpad, he wanted to write something too.<br />
But he was not very good at it, he liked to read the stories of a girl named Lisa on Wattpad, she was a LonelyShipper too.<br />
(Wattpad is a website for people to write and read stories, and for authors to post their stories and gain readers.)<br />
Fred wondered how Lisa could make him feel the emotions that he felt, how she could make him love the characters.<br />
Lisa has published a lot of stories on Wattpad and other writing websites, she loved to write stories.<br />
Fred was trying to learn more about writing and stories, he has written some drafts on his computer.<br />
He wanted to talk to Lisa, to ask for help with writing, Fred noticed that she wrote her Discord name and Discriminator in her profile description.<br />
The text said: "If you want help in writing or you like my stories and want to talk about them, just add me on Discord: Lisa#1321".<br />
Then Fred added her on Discord, Fred already liked and commented on the chapters of Lisa's stories.<br />
But he wanted to talk to her, to ask questions about writing and how to write better.<br />
Fred sent a message to her on Discord, "Hello, how are you, Lisa?" asked him, with a smile emoji.<br />
"I'm Fred from Wattpad, I love your stories, hehe.<br />
You wrote your Discord name and Discriminator on your profile description, right?<br />
You said people could ask for help in writing or talking about your stories.<br />
Sorry for making so many questions, it's that I started writing some months ago, and was trying to get better at writing," explained him.<br />
<br />
After some time, Fred noticed that Lisa was online, he got excited and waited for her to reply, she began typing.<br />
"Hey, Fred, I know you from Wattpad ^^, you always comment and give likes on my stories, thanks for loving them, hehe ^^.<br />
My father's name is also Fred, what a coincidence, hehe.<br />
Thanks for commenting and liking my stories.<br />
Yes, I did that, you can ask for help or talk with me about my stories. :3<br />
It's okay asking questions, I started some months ago too, can I see a piece of your work? Like... The story you're most proud of?" asked her.<br />
"Yes, I will send you the text file of it, okay?" asked Fred, thinking about his draft which was called "The Return of the Beast".<br />
"That's an interesting coincidence, hehe," said Fred about Lisa's father having the same name as him.<br />
"Okay, hehe," replied Lisa with a smiley emoji.<br />
Then Fred sent her a file named "The Return of the Beast.txt" of 17 KB (Kilobytes) size to Lisa.<br />
After some time reading the draft, Lisa started writing a message to Fred.<br />
"That was cool to read, the story was interesting, but the way you executed it, that was a little..." said her, thinking about what to say.<br />
"Bad?" Fred asked.<br />
"Not bad, but, was not... The way you express yourself, or the way you write, feels a little forced.<br />
Try to read more and learn more about how to use words, and how to form phrases, I guess that's my tip for you, try to do that.<br />
Read more and you'll find your style, read stories that you think you'll like, and try to watch something, listen to some music.<br />
Then get those feelings that you're feeling for that thing you're watching or that song and try to get them out, by writing about it.<br />
Write more and more, and keep what you wrote, don't delete it, even if it is bad, after writing it for some time, you'll get better.<br />
And search on the Internet about something you're not sure of, like writing rules, or words, that's what I did.<br />
Keep writing more and you'll become proud of your writing just like me," replied Lisa with a smiley emoji.<br />
"Okay, I will try that, thanks for helping me Lisa, I was scared and excited to talk to you," said Fred.<br />
"Why?" asked Lisa.<br />
"Cause I love your work, and thought you were an inaccessible or busy person," replied Fred.<br />
"If I were inaccessible why I would put my Discord name in my bio? xD<br />
Also, I live in a LonelyShip, so I'm very accessible, I've got nothing to do but play games, write stories, watch things, and eat, haha," said Lisa.<br />
"Oh, that's cool Lisa, I live in one too, hehe, it's very good to meet another LonelyShipper, can I ask your age?" asked Fred.<br />
"Yes, I'm 16 years old, what about you Fred?" asked Lisa.<br />
"I'm 17 years old, hehe," replied Fred.<br />
"It was fun to talk with you, hehe, nice to meet you, Fred," said Lisa.<br />
"Nice to meet you too, Lisa," replied Fred, with a smile emoji.<br />
"I'm gonna leave to write my story called 'The Oddities of Nature', see you later ^^," said Lisa.<br />
"Okay, sorry to bother you ^^," said Fred.<br />
"You didn't bother me, also, I want to read your stories when you get better ^^, please send them to me so I can read them and tell you what I think, hehe," said Lisa.<br />
"It would be an honor to send you some of them ^^, my mentor, hehe," said Fred.<br />
"Aww, I'm not that good, hehe, thanks, Fred 😊," replied Lisa, she was happy.<br />
"See you later, Lisa 😊," said Fred.<br />
<br />
After that, Fred minimized the Discord window and started searching for how to write better and how to use words better.<br />
He wanted to get better at writing to show Lisa his stories and was super excited to do that.<br />
He learned a lot and was trying to write some drafts on his computer, trying to improve every day.<br />
Fred used the Notepad++ program on his computer to write his drafts.<br />
(Notepad++ is a program similar to the Notepad that comes with Windows, but better.)<br />
After some time writing, he wrote something that he liked, Fred was tired, he yawned and relaxed back in the chair.<br />
Fred had the SpaceLiving Network app installed on his computer, he could receive updates and information about the new features that TOTB added to the LonelyShips.<br />
He had applied to the SpaceLiving Helper form, it was a role that helped in the TOTB SpaceLiving server on Discord.<br />
That role had to help in the vent chat, in the help and questions chat, he helped people who were sad and had depression and helped people who had questions about the LonelyShips.<br />
TOTB had created that role for people to volunteer to help in the Discord server, and to help LonelyShippers from all around the galaxy and the universe.<br />
After thinking about some things while looking at the ceiling, Fred turned off his computer and laid in his bed to sleep, Fred wanted to talk to Lisa again to show her his stories.<br />
The LSAI of Fred was called Mary, she turned the LonelyShip's lights off for Fred to sleep, she said good night to him and he said good night back.<br />
He slept, wanting to improve his writing more because he got inspired by someone, he had someone to help him.<br />
Fred waited for a new day to come, where he would write more and more, listen to music, play games, and eat delicious food.<br />
He had a good dream, a really good dream about a certain spaceship and a special someone to him.<br />
<br />
(I wrote this chapter on 17/11/2019 and re-revised it on 25/04/2021.<br />
I liked to put Fred from my story <a class="text_light_brown" href="https://thestake2.netlify.app/The Story of the Bulkan Siblings/en/" target="_blank">"The Story of the Bulkan Siblings"</a> in the SpaceLiving Universe.<br />
I liked to put Fred from my story The Story of the Bulkan Siblings in the SpaceLiving Universe.<br />
<a href="https://thestake2.netlify.app/The%20Story%20of%20the%20Bulkan%20Siblings/en/" target="_blank" class="text_green_water text_hover_green_water">https://thestake2.netlify.app/The%20Story%20of%20the%20Bulkan%20Siblings/en/</a><br />
I love to make crossovers between my stories, Bulkan (TSOTBS), The Life of Littletato (TLOL), and SpaceLiving (SL).<br />
Even if Earth did not exist in the SpaceLiving Universe, I think they would be fine, they don't need Planet Earth.<br />
They have self-sustainable SpaceShips where the energy, food, water, and electricity never end, so why they would need Earth?<br />
Tell me what you think about the story and this little bit here using the "Chapter Comment" button.<br />
Thank you for reading, if you are my friend in Discord, Wattpad, Messenger, Twitter, or Hangouts, please send me a message saying that I'm cute, oops, no.<br />
A message saying that you read this part, thank yoooou ^^ :3)

		Lisa was in her LonelyShip, writing her story called "The Oddities of Nature", she finished the current chapter which was chapter number nine, she saved the text file.<br />
After that, she reviewed and published that chapter of her story on Wattpad, after some minutes, the chapter had five views and two comments.<br />
(Wattpad is a website for people to write and read stories, for authors to post their stories and gain readers.)<br />
Lisa was happy about that, she liked to have people that liked to read what she writes and people who comment on her stories.<br />
Then Lisa opened the Netflix website to watch some series, she liked to watch the "The Walking Dead" series.<br />
(Netflix is a website and mobile app where you can watch series, movies, cartoons, and anime online, using a paid plan.)<br />
Lisa was in the second episode of the seventh season, the girl liked the story and the characters, but she was a little scared to watch it sometimes.<br />
The Discord program was open on her computer when she started watching the episode "The Walking Dead S07E03(86) 'The Cell'".<br />
(Discord is a social network platform for gamers but non-gamers also use it.)<br />
The details of what she was watching appeared on her Discord profile, as a status of the Discord program, showing the title and number of the episode.<br />
She paused the video and got some popcorn and a Coca-cola can from out of her TPF fridge, she liked to eat popcorn while watching things.<br />
Then she sat in her chair and put the video to play, Lisa ate while watching the episode, she opened the SpaceLiving Network App on her computer.<br />
Lisa dimmed the light levels of the LonelyShip to watch the episode better, without the bright light bothering her.<br />
A character from the survivor group of Rick Grimes was jailed in the cell of an enemy of the group, he had to stay there as a hostage.<br />
Lisa was sad for him, she wanted to live there in the apocalypse, Lisa thought that it would be good and fun, but also dangerous.<br />
She wanted to go there to save him, to kill people of the Negan group, the girl hated the Negan group, they killed people for no reason.<br />
After forty minutes of watching it while eating popcorn and drinking Coca-cola, the episode ended, it was registered on Lisa's Netflix account.<br />
The friends of Lisa from Discord could see what Lisa was watching on Netflix, Fred commented about the episode of The Walking Dead that Lisa was watching.<br />
<br />
The girl looked at the window at her left and saw the black emptiness of space, thinking that she can not see the sun like on Earth, but she has the clock on her computer.<br />
She knew that she could change her computer's clock to any time or timezone on Earth, but that would not reflect the actual time in there.<br />
Because there is no way to measure time on the LonelyShip, there is no sun or moon to look at, people could not tell if it was day or night on Earth.<br />
Lisa switched to the Discord window, she wanted to talk with her friends on Discord and changed her status to online, she noticed that Fred was online.<br />
The girl read Fred's message about The Walking Dead and replied to it.<br />
"Did you got better at writing?" asked Lisa.<br />
After some time, Fred replied, "Yes, I searched on the Internet how to get better at writing, how to write better, and I wrote a draft today".<br />
"Oh, that's cool, can I see it?" asked Lisa with smiley emoji.<br />
"Yes, of course, I'll send the file to you, okay?" asked Fred.<br />
"Okay ^^," replied Lisa.<br />
Fred sent her a file named "Bubbles and Cream.txt" with 7KB of size.<br />
"I will read it, wait for a little ^^," replied Lisa.<br />
After some time reading, Lisa opened the Discord window again to reply to Fred.<br />
"I think this is better than the other story you sent me, I mean... The way you wrote, it's very good.<br />
The grammar is better too, I liked the story, I think the concept is interesting, you should publish it somewhere, like Wattpad.<br />
I would be happy to read your story there ^^," replied Lisa.<br />
Then Fred read the whole message and started typing.<br />
"Oh, okay, I'm happy that you think that about my story, I tried to get better at writing just because I admire you and your work so much.<br />
And I wanted to make you proud of me, so thanks for liking my story, I'm very happy because of that, and thanks for helping me get better at writing.<br />
I will post it on Wattpad, thanks for the suggestion ^^," replied Fred.<br />
Then Lisa started typing, "I'm happy that I could help and inspire you too, thanks for that.<br />
I'm gonna make something else now, see you later, Fred ^^," said Lisa.<br />
Fred then replied to Lisa, "Okay, see you later, Lisa, hehe ^^".<br />
<br />
Lisa was so happy that she inspired Fred to get better at writing, which made her want to do more stories and to write more, to inspire people and make them happy.<br />
She was looking at her Direct Messages in Discord and looked at Anny's conversation with her, Anny also had Discord.<br />
Lisa liked to talk with her, she wanted to play some games with Anny.<br />
They are virtual friends, Lisa met her at a game that she played when she was on Earth.<br />
She sent a message to Anny, "Hey Anny, wanna play something?"<br />
"Yes, what do you wanna play?" asked Anny.<br />
"I don't know, maybe GTA 5, or Terraria if you want," replied Lisa.<br />
Anny said. "I would like to play both, hehe, ^^".<br />
Then Lisa and Anny entered a private server on Discord to go on a voice-call, Lisa called a Music Bot to the voice-call to listen to some music while playing with Anny.<br />
Lisa and Anny played the game GTA 5 Online a little, they liked that game, it was very fun, they also played Terraria a little.<br />
They made some theft missions on GTA 5 Online, they chilled around the city while driving.<br />
Lisa and Anny continued building a house for the NPCs (Non-Player Character) to live, the guide, the nurse, and the others, on Terraria.<br />
After some time playing, Lisa stretched a little.<br />
"I'm gonna do something else Anny, see you later ^^," said Lisa on the voice call.<br />
"Okay, hehe, see you later Lisa ^^," replied Anny.<br />
Lisa opened the Mozilla Firefox browser and opened the Wattpad website, she started looking for some stories to read.<br />
(Mozilla Firefox is a web browser.)<br />
She received a notification telling her that the story <a class="text_light_salmon" href="https://thestake2.netlify.app/The Life of Littletato/en/" target="_blank">"The Life of Littletato"</a> received a new chapter, chapter number eighteen.<br />
The story was written by a user called "Stake2", he was a boy, he loved to write stories, he had so much love for his stories.<br />
Lisa liked that story, she liked to see Littletato and Júlia living their lives, she thought they were so cute together and a cute couple.<br />
The girl loved to read the chapter, it was so much fun, she gave it a vote and commented on it saying what she thought of it.<br />
"Hey Stake2 ^^, I loved the part where she opened Vegecord to talk with her friends :3.<br />
Vegecord is Discord, right?<br />
I love it when you change the name of things to put 'vegetables' in the middle xD.<br />
I also liked the fact that Littletato writes stories too, that is so much fun, I love to write too ^^.<br />
And I'm happy for Júlia because she got a job, now she'll be able to buy her things :3.<br />
I liked the conversation between Iam and Júlia, and Júlia inviting him to the barbecue.<br />
'Vegiantart' xD.<br />
I loved this chapter ^^," commented Lisa, on chapter number eighteen of <a class="text_light_salmon" href="https://thestake2.netlify.app/The Life of Littletato/en/" target="_blank">"The Life of Littletato"</a>.<br />
<br />
After some minutes, the author replied to her comment.<br />
"Hello Lisa ^^, thanks for voting on my story, and thanks for liking and commenting on it, I'm really happy to receive your feedback and your comments, hehe ^^.<br />
Yes, Vegecord is equal to Discord xD.<br />
I love to do that xD, sometimes I come up with some very funny names, it is very cool xD.<br />
Sometimes I "self-insert" into her, like, I write Littletato like I would be, or how I would act, and sometimes my interests.<br />
That's why she likes reading and writing stories, it's because I like it ^^.<br />
Hehe, I'm happy to find someone that loves writing as much as me :3.<br />
I liked to write about Júlia getting a job, and about her conversation with Iam.<br />
It was so much fun writing about Júlia trying to find a job, and finding it, hehe, it'll be better when she starts working ^^.<br />
uwu xD.<br />
I'm glad that you loved it ^^, thankies you for commenting :3," commented Stake2, replying to Lisa's comment.<br />
<br />
Lisa was happy to give feedback and to comment on the stories that she liked, she also liked to receive a happy and gentle response like the one of Stake2.<br />
She felt hungry, got up, and opened her TPF fridge, there was a packet of chocolate stuffed biscuits there, a packet of Doritos, and also a cup of Coca-cola inside it.<br />
Lisa picked up all the things and placed them on top of her computer table, she opened the packet of chocolate biscuits and filled a plastic bowl that she grabbed from the fridge with them.<br />
She opened a movie on Netflix to watch, the movie was called "Avengers: Infinity War".<br />
The girl watched the movie while eating the biscuits, Doritos, and drinking a cup of Coca-cola.<br />
She liked the movie, it was very fun, she was happy to see all the action, special effects, and heroes, she cheered for Iron Man.<br />
Lisa added the movie to her list of watched movies, it was a text file inside her computer, where she registered all of her watched movies.<br />
She registered the movie on the text files of her History of Watched things with a Python script called Watch.py, Lisa also knew how to code, to make programs to help her.<br />
The girl had a friend that she met in Google+, the username of her friend on Discord was "Funkysnipa Cat", the same he used in Google+.<br />
(Google+ was a social network website created by Google in 2011, in an attempt to challenge other social networks, linking other Google products like Google Drive, Blogger, and YouTube.<br />
Google+ died on 2 of April 2019 due to people finding out the privacy violations that Google had hidden about Google+.<br />
And Google closed Google+ because it felt shame about the privacy violations, Google+ was house to a lot of fans of things and new fandoms.<br />
Such as the Five Night's at Freddy's Fandom in 2014, My Little Pony, anime. a lot of Brazilians loved to use Google+, there was a movement called the Funky Cats on Google+.<br />
Funkysnipa Cat was in that movement, Google decided to continue working on Google+ but only for companies, and continued fixing the privacy errors.)<br />
Funkysnipa Cat was the first to start the conversation on Discord when Lisa and he met again.<br />
Lisa opened the Hangouts app of Google to ask Funkysnipa Cat for his Discord name and discriminator.<br />
(Hangouts is an app that was linked to Google+, and you could use your Google+ account to talk in it.)<br />
He and Lisa were Brazilians and native speakers of the Brazilian Portuguese language.<br />
"Hello, you're that friend I had in Google+, right?" Funkysnipa Cat asked in Brazilian Portuguese<br />
"Hey, yes, I'm that friend ^^, I'm glad that I asked for your Discord name and discriminator," replied Lisa.<br />
They talked a little and started to know each other again, they liked to talk about stories, anime, cartoons, series, video games, and music, they had a lot in common.<br />
Both Funky and Lisa loved to write stories, Lisa wanted to write a story together with Funky sometime.<br />
The real name of Funky was Izaque, Lisa liked to be his friend, she was happy to have a gentle, caring, and interesting friend such as him.<br />
Izaque was happy about meeting Lisa in that Google+ community about anime.<br />
While talking to Lisa on Discord, Izaque remembered their first conversation on Hangouts.<br />
They were talking about My Little Pony and anime, Lisa said that she liked the Eromanga Sensei anime, Izaque said that his first anime was Sword Art Online.<br />
After some time getting to know more about each other, Izaque discovered that Lisa lived inside a LonelyShip.<br />
Izaque lived on the normal Planet Earth, he thought that was an interesting fact about Lisa, the fact that she lives inside a spaceship.<br />
<br />
At the beginning of the conversation, Izaque sent Lisa the link to his Wattpad profile, Lisa and Izaque talked about stories for a while.<br />
Lisa looked at Izaque's profile on Wattpad, she noticed that he was Stake2, the writer who created <a class="text_light_salmon" href="https://thestake2.netlify.app/The Life of Littletato/en/" target="_blank">"The Life of Littletato"</a>.<br />
After that, she came back to Discord to type a message to Izaque.<br />
"Izaque... Are you Stake2?!" asked Lisa, surprised.<br />
"Yeah... Sorry for not telling you," replied Izaque.<br />
"I love your stories! Hehe, so you're a professional writer, hehe," said Lisa with a smirk as an emoji.<br />
"Hehe, I'm not that good, but thanks, you don't fall behind too, I love The Oddities of Nature, hehe ^^," said Izaque.<br />
"Thanks! Hehe :3, let's write something together sometime okay?" asked Lisa.<br />
"I would love to, Lisa ^^," replied Izaque.<br />
They also played some games together sometimes, while talking on Discord voice calls.<br />
The author of this story is Izaque or Funkysnipa Cat, but that is the SpaceLiving Universe version of Izaque.<br />
Yes, that's it, I'm Izaque and I'm writing about Lisa, my dear friend, this is a weird thing to do, right? Well, maybe not, I asked for her permission.<br />
Because a lot of stories do not talk directly with the reader, they tell a story to the reader.<br />
But now I'm talking directly to you, and I include myself in my own story, is it common for authors to do this?<br />
Please answer me if you know xD.<br />
I think you're probably making a face like this right now: "O_O", now, going back to narrator style.<br />
Lisa said to Izaque what she did on the days that she spent on her LonelyShip, she told him about the SpaceLiving Network and the LonelyShips.<br />
He wanted to write a story about Lisa living on the SpaceLiving Network, Lisa explained the things to him.<br />
Then Izaque started writing his story called "SpaceLiving", about the SpaceLiving SpaceShip Network in 2019.<br />
Izaque loved to write that story (*wink*), it was a story about the SpaceShip that Lisa lived, and also about the spaceships network called the SpaceLiving SpaceShip Network.<br />
He analyzed the day of Lisa and wrote a story about that, then he sent the story text file to Lisa for her to check.<br />
Lisa read the first chapter of the story, she liked it, Lisa gave Izaque permission to publish his story on Wattpad and to send the story to his friends.<br />
The girl thought that she had a happy life, she wrote stories, had some good friends like Izaque, Anny, and Fred to talk with.<br />
She could eat delicious food using her TPF fridge, she was happy living in her LonelyShip, writing, watching anime, and other things.<br />
Izaque wrote, revised, and posted the first chapter of the SpaceLiving story on Wattpad, he sent the link to Lisa on Discord.<br />
Lisa read the whole chapter, it was very good, and it explained very well the SpaceLiving Network, and how it worked, she gave a vote and commented on the story.<br />
Then, she began writing a message to Izaque on Discord.<br />
<br />
"Hey Izaque, I loved the first chapter of SpaceLiving, hehe, it was so well written.<br />
You described the systems and technologies of the LonelyShips very well, and about the wish of TOTB to make teens happy.<br />
Thanks for writing it, hehe, I'll wait anxiously for the next chapter, tell me if you need more content, hehe ^^," said Lisa in her message.<br />
"Hehe, thanks, I'm glad that you loved it, Lisa, hehe ^^, I like to write about technologies, I love them xD.<br />
I want to write about this friend of yours, Fred, as you said to me.<br />
Can you ask him if he's willing to share his SpaceLiving story?" asked Izaque.<br />
"Oh, okay, I'm gonna ask him ^^," replied Lisa.<br />
The girl felt a little tired, she said goodbye to Izaque, telling him goodnight, thanking him for the talk, smiling happily while looking at the screen.<br />
Lisa turned her computer off and laid on her bed, the LSAI, Ana, turned the LonelyShip's lights off and Lisa could see the moon through the left window of the spaceship.<br />
Ana left the LonelyShip turning slowly, using its turbines, for Lisa to see the moon, sun, and the Earth moving slowly through the windows.<br />
The LonelyShip's temperature was very good, she covered herself with the blanket and slept, having good dreams about the spaceship, and her friends.<br />
<br />
(I write this chapter on 19/11/2019.<br />
I finished re-revising it on 26/04/2021.<br />
<br />
I revised while listening to some Dubstep songs.<br />
And I arrived at a song that I loved, I left it on repeat.<br />
The song is called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2P1_v9aFV8" target="_blank">"Skybreak & Mizu - Aurora"</a>.<br />
I love that song so much, it is awesome! So calm and good to listen to while writing SpaceLiving, hehe xD.<br />
I love to sing it and feel it while writing SpaceLiving or anything.<br />
That song makes me feel so happy, I suggest that you listen to it, hehe :3.)

		<h4 id="chapter_4_text" class="text_size unselectable  text_green_water" style="text-align: left;">
		There was a boy that also lived in a LonelyShip, his name was Ted and had brown hair, he had nineteen years old and loved to spend time on his spaceship, eating things and watching Netflix.<br />
(Netflix is a website and mobile app where you can watch series, movies, cartoons, and anime online, using a paid plan.)<br />
But his spaceship was different, it had a teleporter in it.<br />
The teleporter was called LonelyShip Teleporter, the initials were LST and were written on the upper part of its plastic frame, the LST was blue.<br />
(That teleporter did not exist in older versions of the LonelyShip, but now every SpaceLiving resident has one in their spaceship.)<br />
It was something like a bathroom box but it was glued to the spaceship walls like it was built along with the spaceship.<br />
It was blue and the thicker part of the LST was dark blue, its plastic door had a lighter blue, and its plastic background had an even lighter blue.<br />
That teleporter could teleport him back to Earth whenever he wanted to.<br />
To see his family, and to know about what was happening on Earth.<br />
To teleport to Earth using the LST teleporter, a resident of the spaceship would need to send an LST synchronization request to a trusted house.<br />
You can select a house by choosing its location on Earth, or using a social media profile from one of the persons that live on the trusted house.<br />
Like the house of your parents, you can send an LST sync request to them and they will receive a hologram message to accept the request.<br />
Then, if they accept, a little robot with wheels would fall from a satellite built by TOTB, it would fall close to the trusted house.<br />
It would go inside the house and choose a good location for the LST teleporter, it would then disintegrate and would generate the LST using its separated parts.<br />
The resident has the choice to open the LST door or not when arriving at the trusted house.<br />
If the house was thought to be trusted but is not, then the resident can press the emergency button to teleport back to their LonelyShip.<br />
He could also teleport to the spaceships of other LonelyShippers, the residents of the SpaceLiving SpaceShip Network.<br />
Ted could simply enter inside the teleporter, close the door, and type the Discord nick and discriminator of the person on the LST's keyboard.<br />
Then his spaceship would send a teleport request to the person that owned that spaceship.<br />
If the person accepted, then a blue light would appear inside the teleporter, and Ted would go to the selected spaceship.<br />
He was also on the official Discord server of the SpaceLiving Network.<br />
Ted was a little famous in the city that he lived in before being teleported to a LonelyShip.<br />
The people on Earth knew about the LonelyShippers and the SpaceLiving Network.<br />
But they never had seen a LonelyShipper that came back to Earth, they thought that everyone was stuck on their spaceships and could never leave.<br />
That is why Ted was famous, he could go out of his LonelyShip to tell people about the SpaceLiving Network.<br />
Sometimes, Ted teleported back to Earth to visit his family and see how his city was evolving, he was happy to see his city get bigger.<br />
The city that Ted was born in was Los Angeles, in California.<br />
He liked his life, he was still a civilian on Earth but he liked more to spend some time on his LonelyShip.<br />
<br />
One day, he was sat on the chair of his super-fast computer, eating some lasagna with a cup of Coca-cola while watching a live stream of the Youtuber Cellbit on Twitch.<br />
(YouTube is a website where you can watch videos and upload videos too, there are lots of gameplay videos, songs, makeup, fun videos, animation, movies.)<br />
(Twitch is a website where you can watch the live stream, the majority of them are of gaming, but there's also chat, instruments, song Livestreams, trips, react.)<br />
After eating and waiting thirty minutes, he got up and grabbed a bottle of water on the TPF fridge, then placed the bottle on top of the table at the right of his mouse.<br />
Ted dragged the live stream window to his second screen, the Twitch website where he was watching the live stream was open on the Mozilla Firefox web browser.<br />
(Mozilla Firefox is a web browser where you can navigate the Internet.)<br />
The screen where Twitch was open was the right screen, Ted opened a new window of Mozilla Firefox and opened the Netflix website.<br />
Ted took a look at the catalog, he did not found anything that he was interested to watch at the moment.<br />
Then he closed the browser windows, Ted opened the Steam gaming platform to play some games, he opened Terraria to play.<br />
(Steam is software where you can download free and paid games to play on your computer.)<br />
Ted played on a multiplayer server, he played for thirty minutes, finished building his house, and got a better pickax too.<br />
After playing for a while, he closed the game.<br />
The boy missed his family and his life on Earth, it has been some months since he was on Earth.<br />
Ted turned off his computer and got up, he opened the door of the LST teleporter, wore some slippers, and entered inside the teleporter.<br />
Then he closed the door and selected "Planet Earth" on the screen that the teleporter had.<br />
The image and name of Planet Earth got bigger, it showed a house image on the inferior part and the location of the house of Ted's parents was written at the right of it.<br />
He clicked on the house image, confirming his choice.<br />
Then a blue light appeared on the bottom of the LST teleporter, a sound was being emitted, going up in pitch.<br />
Ted could only see the light, not the interior of his spaceship, after some seconds, the sound stopped and he was inside the LST teleporter of the house of his parents.<br />
The Earth LST was in the kitchen of Ted's parents' house.<br />
His parents were eating, they got up to see Ted, Ted opened the LST's door and got outside of it.<br />
Ted's parents hugged him, smiling and saying they missed him, the trio got a little emotional.<br />
After that, the parents of Ted came back to the kitchen table, sitting, they invited Ted to eat with them.<br />
Then they ate lunch, Ted's parents said that they were going to the market to buy some things.<br />
The father of Ted was called John, his mother was called Ana.<br />
John had brown hair, Ana had blond hair.<br />
Ted said that he was going downtown, his parents said ok, said goodbye, and left the house.<br />
He remembered a sister that he had while he was very young, he disappeared from his house at a very young age.<br />
Ted does not know how that happened, he does not remember, he feels sad for leaving his family like that.<br />
He wanted to find his sister again, to meet her and say that he is sorry.<br />
The boy wanted to see a friend of his, he did not know if that person lived in Los Angeles.<br />
He only talked with that friend through the Internet, he never saw that person in real life.<br />
But he knew that friend did not live inside a LonelyShip.<br />
Ted grabbed a backpack with things like water, food, and put it on his back.<br />
He locked the house and walked outside.<br />
<br />
After walking a little, Ted arrived downtown, he had brought the smartphone that he had on his spaceship.<br />
Ted met that friend two years ago on the Internet, on Discord.<br />
(Discord is a social network platform for gamers but non-gamers also use it.)<br />
His friend was a girl called Monika, she had eighteen years old and had brown hair.<br />
Ted sent a message to Monika asking where she lived, he said that he was on Earth.<br />
Monika sent her address to Ted, Ted thought he would need a taxi, an Uber, or something like that to be able to visit her.<br />
He thought that she lived in another city, the parents of Ted lived in Los Angeles, California.<br />
To his surprise, Monika lived in Los Angeles too.<br />
Monika was happy that she was finally going to meet her virtual friend.<br />
Ted caught a bus to go there, he arrived there and knocked on the door.<br />
Monika opened the door for him and let him in, she told him to feel at home.<br />
"Hello, I'm Ted, your virtual friend from Discord," said Ted, smiling while blushing, looking at Monika.<br />
"Hey, so you're Ted, I'm Monika, nice to meet in person, hehe," said Monika, smiling too.<br />
"I... Already saw a picture of you, but... You're even more beautiful in person..." said Ted, blushing.<br />
Monika blushed and looked away, "Thanks Ted..." said her, smiling while blushing.<br />
Then Ted walked around the living room and sat on the couch.<br />
"Hey, do you want a cup of water?" asked Monika, smiling.<br />
"Yes, please," replied Ted, smiling too.<br />
Then Monika closed the door and walked to the kitchen, she grabbed a glass and filled it with water, then walked back to the living room.<br />
Ted drank the water and then gave the glass to Monika.<br />
"Thanks," said Ted.<br />
"No problem, hehe," replied Monika.<br />
She walked to the kitchen and left the glass on top of the sink.<br />
<br />
Then Monika walked back to the living room, sitting on the couch and looking at Ted.<br />
"So, you know that I live in a LonelyShip, right?" asked Ted.<br />
"Yes, you told me that some days after we started talking," replied Monika.<br />
"Okay, hmm..." said Ted, thinking a little, looking at the floor, "I... Like you... I started to like you some months ago Monika...<br />
You're interesting, smart, you like to play piano, to code in Python... And to read, you like literature...<br />
I like all those things too, you even helped me with my code one day, and... I'm speaking too much, aren't I?" asked Ted.<br />
"No, it's okay, hehe," said Monika, who leaned close to Ted and hugged him, giving him a long kiss on his lips with her eyes closed.<br />
Ted was surprised and shocked by that, he blushed a lot while feeling Monika's mouth touching his, he closed his eyes and hugged Monika back, enjoying the kiss.<br />
After some minutes, Monika broke from the kiss and leaned back, smiling while looking at Ted.<br />
"I wanted to tell you this since I met you... Since I started loving you, you're such a good friend," said Ted, smiling.<br />
"Yes, you're a good friend too, Ted.<br />
It's incredible how time goes fast... We know each other for two years already Ted!" said Monika smiling happily.<br />
"Oh... Really?... I love you, Monika... Thanks for being here for me... Thanks for always helping me.<br />
Our friendship is incredible, right? Two years... Who would have thought..." said Ted looking at the floor while thinking.<br />
"I love you too..." said Monika smiling.<br />
"Do you want to be my girlfriend?" asked Ted, smiling.<br />
"Of course you silly!" said Monika, jumping on Ted's arms and hugging him tightly.<br />
Ted started caressing Monika's beautiful light brown hair, smiling and feeling her smell.<br />
"Do you want to live in a LonelyShip with me, honey?" asked Ted.<br />
"Of course, hehe," said Monika, smiling.<br />
"Then you have to go to my house because the LST teleporter is there, hehe," said Ted smiling while looking at Monika.<br />
"What is the LST teleporter honey?" asked Monika, curious.<br />
"It is the LonelyShip Teleporter, it lets you teleport between the LonelyShips and also teleport to Earth.<br />
It is a test of the Think Outside The Box company or TOTB, they're sending this teleporter to people to fix some bugs and errors that it has.<br />
It's not an official thing.<br />
I was one of the people that received the teleporter in their spaceships, so I can use it to go back to Earth whenever I want," explained Ted.<br />
"Oh, that's cool honey, let's go there, but first I have to call my sister, she said that she wanted to live here in Los Angeles.<br />
So I'll transfer the house to her name, and she will pay the bills, okay?" asked Monika.<br />
"Okay honey," replied Ted.<br />
Then Monika grabbed her smartphone and sent a message to her sister Sayori, saying that she is going to move to another house.<br />
That Sayori can stay with the house if she pays the bills, Monika said that she is going to get her stuff and leave today.<br />
Sayori said that she wanted to stay with the house, she said that she is going to do a trip tomorrow to bring her stuff, she lived in another city.<br />
<br />
"I told her that I'm moving today, and she said that she is going to bring her stuff here tomorrow.<br />
I'm gonna transfer the house to her name after tomorrow after she moves in.<br />
Do you want to help me pack up my stuff so we can bring it to your house honey?" asked Monika.<br />
"You don't need that honey, the LonelyShip is going to teleport everything that you own when you teleport to the LonelyShip.<br />
The LonelyShip can teleport clothes, smartphones, hard drive data from your computer, USB sticks, pets, and other personal stuff.<br />
The teleporter is small, only two people can fit inside, and..." said Ted, unsure about something.<br />
"Oh, okay, so we just need to teleport to the spaceship right? And?..." asked Monika.<br />
"Yes, and... I'm not sure if the LonelyShip will detect that you're there and that you want to live with me.<br />
The spaceship has only stuff for one person, one fridge, one computer, one wardrobe, one bed.<br />
But the LonelyShip knows a lot about feelings, love, and friendship, so maybe it will detect that you want to live with me," said Ted, a little unsure of what he was saying.<br />
"Oh... So we will have only one bed right?" asked Monika looking at Ted with a naughty face.<br />
"Monika, you naughty girl, hehe," said Ted smiling while blushing.<br />
"Hehe, we'll sleep together if the spaceship does not detect our love, right?" said Monika while giggling a little.<br />
"Yes, hehe," said Ted, smiling.<br />
<br />
(I wrote this chapter on 24/11/2019.<br />
And finished revising it on 27/04/2021.<br />
<br />
The adventures of Ted and Monika will continue in the next chapter.<br />
I liked to write about Ted, write about his parents, and his fame for being a LonelyShipper that can go to Earth.<br />
And I liked writing that Ted has a sister who is a certain someone... I don't know, hehe.<br />
Someone that is also the child of parents named John and Ana...<br />
Thank you for reading this chapter of SpaceLiving, hehe ^^.)

		In the last chapter, Ted traveled to Earth to visit his parents, it has been some months since he visited Earth.<br />
He visited his virtual friend Monika in person for the first time, he was so happy.<br />
Ted declared his love for Monika, Monika said she loved him too, and they became a couple.<br />
The boy lived in a LonelyShip alone, he wanted to live inside his LonelyShip with his new girlfriend.<br />
The girl accepted his invitation, they would live inside Ted's LonelyShip together.<br />
Monika said that her sister wanted to live in Los Angeles, the city that Monika lives in.<br />
She told her sister, Sayori, that she was going to move outside Los Angeles, and said that Sayori could live in her house.<br />
Monika said that she was moving today, Sayori told Monika that she is going to move her stuff there tomorrow.<br />
The girl would transfer the house's ownership to Sayori after she moves in tomorrow.<br />
The couple only needed to teleport to Ted's LonelyShip, the spaceship would teleport Monika's stuff there, her clothes and other personal stuff.<br />
In this chapter...<br />
<br />
"So, let's go to your house honey," said Monika, smiling.<br />
"Okay cutie, hehe," said Ted, smiling too.<br />
Then Monika closed the house, she sent a message to Sayori saying that she was leaving the house.<br />
Sayori replied saying okay, she started to pack her things in her house that was in another city.<br />
Ted and Monika started walking to Ted's house.<br />
After some minutes of walking, they arrived there, Ted's parents were home already.<br />
"Hey, son, who is this?" asked John, the father of Ted.<br />
"Hey dad, mom, this is... My girlfriend, Monika, I already told you guys about her.<br />
But... She was my friend back then," said Ted while blushing a little, talking low, and feeling happy when introducing his girlfriend to his parents.<br />
"Oh, congratulations son, my name is John," said John, smiling, happy that his son got a girlfriend.<br />
The mother of Ted, Ana, walked close to Monika, she smiled and held her hand, "Nice to meet you, I'm Ana," said her, smiling, proud to have a daughter-in-law.<br />
"Nice to meet you, Ana," said Monika while smiling.<br />
Ana smiled while looking at Monika.<br />
"Nice to meet you, John," said Monika while looking at him.<br />
"Nice to meet you too," said John, smiling.<br />
"So, dad, we're moving to my LonelyShip, it's been a pleasure to see you two again, I love you two," said Ted, who hugged his mother, then his father.<br />
Ana and John returned Ted's hug.<br />
"Good trip son," said Ana, "Travel safe".<br />
"Good trip my boy," said John.<br />
Then Ted walked close to the LST teleporter that existed in the kitchen of the house of Ted's parents, Monika was following him.<br />
He opened the LST's door and entered inside it, Monika did the same, it was six PM.<br />
Ted typed his LonelyShip code which was #512, a blue light appeared on the floor of the LST teleporter.<br />
<br />
After some seconds, Ted and Monika were inside Ted's LonelyShip.<br />
Monika saw Ted's LonelyShip in a photo that he sent to her, but she never saw it in person.<br />
She was really happy seeing it, it had beautiful blue walls, a blue TPF fridge, a blue LST teleporter, a blue wardrobe, a blue computer desk, and a blue bed with a blue bed sheet.<br />
Everything was blue, Ted liked the color blue, it was the default color for the fridge and LST teleporter, he changed the wall colors and the other things that were white-colored.<br />
Changing the wall color of the LonelyShip was a feature that was in test by TOTB, Ted received that feature to test.<br />
It also had a bathroom, a laser turret outside the LonelyShip, and a treadmill that was inside the wall but could go out when it was going to be used.<br />
The LonelyShip started to move a little, Ted held on to Monika so he would not shake, he did not know what was happening.<br />
After some minutes, the spaceship created a copy of Ted's LonelyShip, that copy was connected physically with Ted's spaceship.<br />
Now Ted's LonelyShip is a LovelyShip, not Lonely anymore, now there is two of everything, two beds, wardrobes, computers, chairs, TPF Fridges, bathrooms, and LST Teleporters.<br />
Monika walked to her bed and laid on it, enjoying the fluffiness of the mattress.<br />
Monika's side of the LovelyShip was green colored, but it was a dark green, not bad for the eyes.<br />
Everything was green, green, and blue, Ted liked that color combination.<br />
"I never laid in a bed so fluffy, hehe," said Monika smiling.<br />
"This is incredible honey, I would never think about something like this, I love being in here with you," continued her, smiling while looking at Ted, moving on the bed.<br />
Monika was happy, she got off the bed and walked to her tall window, she could see the Earth from far away, the moon too, the sun was on Ted's window.<br />
"Yes, it is incredible honey, I love to live inside my LonelyShip, it makes me calm, makes me feel like I have my place to spend some time alone.<br />
And now you're here, now I don't need to feel lonely anymore," said Ted, who walked close to Monika and started looking at Earth with Monika, hugging her.<br />
"Aww honey, you're so cute," said Monika, who squeezed Ted's cheek softly and kissed it.<br />
"Hehe, so, do you wanna learn anything about the LovelyShip honey?" asked Ted.<br />
"Yes, how does the TPF Fridge work?" asked Monika, curious.<br />
Ted walked to Monika's TPF Fridge while holding her hand.<br />
"The food and beverage generated by the TPF are nutrients, so if you eat a pizza, you don't need to feel guilty, they are just nutrients, not lots of cheese.<br />
You can think about some food or beverage and the TPF will generate it for you," explained Ted, who opened the door of the TPF while thinking of a slice of pizza on a plate.<br />
There was a slice of pizza on top of a plate inside the fridge.<br />
"And you can also remove food if you don't want it anymore," said Ted, not wanting the pizza slice anymore, closing the TPF, and opening it again.<br />
The pizza slice was no more, and the plate disappeared.<br />
"Oh, that's really interesting honey! I'll never get hungry this way," said Monika, smiling while looking at the TPF fridge.<br />
"You'll get hungry, but it's far easier to get food with the fridge, you don't need to cook, and you can eat on time, hehe," said Ted, smiling.<br />
"Yeah, hehe, thanks for teaching me this honey," said Monika, smiling.<br />
"No problem my cutie, so, wanna give it a try?" asked Ted.<br />
"Yes," said Monika, who thought about a cheesecake, then she opened the fridge, there was a cheesecake inside the fridge.<br />
"That's incredible, hehe," said Monika smiling.<br />
"Yeah, hehe," said Ted, who walked to his side of the LovelyShip, lying on his bed.<br />
<br />
"Hey honey, let's watch a movie," said Monika looking at Ted, she closes the TPF and thought about a plate, a fork, and a knife.<br />
"Okay hon, I'm gonna open Netflix," said Ted, who got up and sat on his computer chair, he turned his computer on.<br />
Monika opened the TPF Fridge and there was an empty gray plate of ceramic with a fork and a knife on top of it.<br />
Ted opened the Mozilla Firefox web browser on his computer and opened the Netflix website.<br />
(Netflix is a website and mobile app where you can watch series, movies, cartoons, and anime online, using a paid plan.)<br />
He chose a movie called "Little Manhattan" from 2005 to watch, he put the movie on full screen.<br />
A hole formed on the wall behind the screens of the computers of the couple.<br />
The screens of both Ted's computer and Monika's computer entered inside the hole.<br />
After that, the hole closed itself, like pistons were moving inside it.<br />
Then a big and wide screen appeared from the inside of a hole that formed on the wall.<br />
The big screen was high on the wall, the couple could lay on the bed and watch the movie from far away.<br />
The screen was big enough so they could see the details of the remastered 4K version of the movie.<br />
Ted left the movie on pause and waited for Monika to come to watch it.<br />
Monika grabbed the gray plate and the fork, she cut a slice of the cheesecake for her.<br />
Then she grabbed the knife and left it on top of the plate with the fork, she closed the fridge's door and thought about a can of Coca-cola.<br />
After that, there was a Coca-cola can inside the fridge, Monika grabbed it and the plate with the slice of cheesecake, and she sat on her bed with the food and drink.<br />
Ted got up and opened his TPF fridge, he grabbed a hamburger on top of a plate from the inside of it and a can of Coca-cola.<br />
Then he sat on the bed, a TV controller appeared from inside of the wall and landed on top of Ted's computer table.<br />
Ted grabbed it and sat on the bed again, the LovelyShip's Artificial Intelligence moved the beds close to each other, so Monika and Ted could watch the movie close together.<br />
<br />
After that, Ted pressed play on the TV controller and relaxed on his bed.<br />
The couple started to eat and drink while watching the movie, Little Manhattan, which was a romance and drama movie.<br />
Monika and Ted smiled seeing the love of Gabe, the main character, for Rosemary, an eleven-year-old girl.<br />
In half of the movie, Monika and Ted already finished eating their food and drinking their Coca-cola.<br />
After one hour and fifty minutes, the movie ended, and the main character did not date the girl at the end of the movie.<br />
The couple got sad because of that, but they were happy because Gabe's parents reconciled with each other.<br />
Monika and Ted hugged each other and closed their eyes, relaxing with each other.<br />
Monika had never watched that movie before, she liked it, Ted already watched it before, and he wanted to show the movie to Monika.<br />
Ted got up and exited the full-screen mode of the web browser using the ESC key of his computer keyboard.<br />
A hole formed behind the big screen and the screen entered inside the hole.<br />
Then the screens of Ted's and Monika's computers were back.<br />
<br />
Ted looked at the hours on his computer screen, the hours were on the inferior right side of the screen.<br />
It was 11:00 PM, and Ted and Monika were a little tired.<br />
"So, do you want to sleep with me honey?" asked Monika with a naughty face.<br />
"Of course hon, hehe," said Ted, smiling naughtily.<br />
Then Monika got up and placed her Coca-cola can, the empty plate, fork, and knife inside the TPF fridge.<br />
She did not want the cheesecake anymore, so she closed the TPF's door, she opened the door again, but the cheesecake was no more, the plate was gone too.<br />
Ted did the same, placing his empty plate inside the TPF fridge and closing it.<br />
Then he turned his computer off and used the bathroom.<br />
The LovelyShip's bathroom and the bathroom of all LonelyShips had a laser toilet that melted everything inside when you pressed the flush button.<br />
Ted got out of the bathroom and looked at Monika, smiling.<br />
Monika got up, "I wish there was a way for us to sleep together, and not like these two beds close to each other," said her, looking a little sad.<br />
Then a hole formed below the two beds, making them fall softly inside of the spaceship, a double bed got out of the hole, and it was closed.<br />
Ted found that very technological, he lay on top of the double bed and smiled at Monika again.<br />
"The spaceship knows what you're feeling hon," said him.<br />
"Hehe, it is so good and caring, feels like a mother, a mother that wants their children happy and comfortable," said Monika, smiling while looking at the ceiling.<br />
Then Monika lay beside Ted and hugged him tightly, kissing his lips, the couple closed their eyes, relaxing on the double bed.<br />
"I think it's gonna take some time for me to get used to living in here.<br />
But... With you here, it makes everything easier, I know you'll help me, hehe.<br />
And I want to live with you here, I want to stay by your side forever hon because you're the one that I love," said Monika, smiling happily while looking at Ted.<br />
"Aww, hon... That makes me so happy, I want to stay by your side forever too, I love you a lot, I'm not lonely anymore, now that I have you..." said Ted, who kissed Monika's lips.<br />
"Hmm, hehe, me too, I love you so much, hon!" said Monika, who hugged Ted tight, closing her eyes.<br />
Ted also closed his eyes, smiling happily while hugging Monika.<br />
The LovelyShip's AI turned the LovelyShip's lights off automatically, feeling that the couple was going to sleep.<br />
They slept on a warm night, but not too hot, the LovelyShip's temperature system was synchronized with their body's temperature, creating a cozy environment to sleep.<br />
<br />
(I love to write about Monika and Ted's adventure, it was so good and made me so happy.<br />
I don't remember when I wrote this chapter, but I know it was in 2019.<br />
I finished re-revising it on 28/04/2021, it was so good, hehe.<br />
Thank you for reading this chapter ^^.)

		SpaceLiving, Chapter Six, The SpaceShip update and the reunion of brothers.<br />
*A message appears on the screen where you are reading this story...*<br />
*The message is from the enterprise Think Outside The Box that created the LonelyShips and the SpaceLiving Network.*<br />
It says:<br />
"SpaceLiving SpaceShip Network, Update number 1.3.709.<br />
A new update to the LonelyShips has been made, it brings wall color changes.<br />
Requests of changes of equipment, and the possibility of making a double LonelyShip.<br />
Now you can come close to your bed and raise your hand, a new mechanical-physical menu will appear.<br />
You can choose the new color of the walls, bed, table, TPF Fridge, and other stuff.<br />
And you can request a change of equipment too, like, you see a new screen that has a 144hz refresh rate on the Internet.<br />
Then you get closer to your screen and raise your hand, a new button will appear close to it.<br />
That button is called "Change Equipment", your can change your screen, computer case, video games, smartphone, or headphones.<br />
Or you can use the SpaceLiving App for Windows 10, clicking on the LonelyShip - LS tab, clicking on the Manage things tab, Edit, and on the Electronics option.<br />
You can also use the SpaceLiving extension on your favorite browser to send electronics to the SpaceLiving App by clicking with the right mouse button on the electronic link.<br />
Enabling you to modify your electronic equipment.<br />
The SpaceLiving App comes installed on your computer by default, along with an installation of a modified version of Windows 10.<br />
That version is called Windows 10 (SpaceLiving Edition).<br />
Some users are receiving a new device that we created called the "LonelyShip Teleporter" or LST, you can use it to go back to Earth if you want.<br />
(This teleporter did not exist in older versions of the LonelyShip, but now every SpaceLiving resident has one in their spaceship.)<br />
To teleport to Earth using the LST teleporter, you would need to send an LST synchronization request to a trusted house.<br />
You can select a house by choosing its location on Earth, or using a social media profile from one of the persons that live on the trusted house.<br />
Like the house of your parents, you can send an LST synchronization request to them and they will receive a hologram message to accept the request.<br />
Then, if they accept, a little robot would fall from a satellite built by TOTB, it would fall close to the trusted house.<br />
It would go inside the house and choose a good location for the LST teleporter, it would then disintegrate and would generate the LST using its separated parts.<br />
The resident has the choice to open the LST door or not when arriving at the trusted house.<br />
If the house was thought to be trusted but is not, then the resident can press the emergency button to teleport back to their LonelyShip.<br />
The LST can also teleport the resident to the spaceships of other LonelyShippers, the residents of the SpaceLiving Network.<br />
Also, you can now invite people to your LonelyShip, to live there with you, it will transform the spaceship into a Double-LonelyShip.<br />
You can use the LST to go to Earth and ask a person to join your LonelyShip.<br />
If you and this person use the LST at the same time, and the person wants to live in your LonelyShip.<br />
Then the spaceship will begin to change, move and add plus one of everything that you have, it will be a copy of your side of the LonelyShip.<br />
White walls, super-fast computer, TPF, the LST, bathroom, bed, wardrobe, the default things that come on every LonelyShip.<br />
The Artificial Intelligence of the LonelyShip will change the name of the spaceship depending on the relationship between you and your spaceship partner.<br />
If your partner and you are in a romantic relationship, then the spaceship will be called LovelyShip.<br />
If you and your partner are friends, it will be called a FriendShip.<br />
You can also join the Discord server of SpaceLiving, join the server at <a href="https://discord.com/invite/NYN4CCu" target="_blank">"Discord server of the SpaceLiving Network"</a>.<br />
This is the end of the change-log for the LonelyShips, this was written by Think Outside The Box, defend yourself from the asteroids, stay safe, take care, and be lonely! :D".<br />
*The message disappears...*<br />
<br />
A LonelyShipper was seeing this message, he was in his LonelyShip, the walls of his LonelyShip had the orange color.<br />
The name of that LonelyShipper was Izaque.<br />
He loved his LonelyShip, Izaque loved to listen to some Dubstep in his LonelyShip, blasting it on the speakers.<br />
Izaque also made some live streams on Twitch, showing what he was doing to his subscribers.<br />
(Twitch is a website where you can watch live streams, the majority of them are of gaming, but there is also chat, instruments, song live streams, trips, react.)<br />
He liked to download songs from the SoundCloud website, to play games on Steam.<br />
(Steam is software where you can download free and paid games to play on your computer.)<br />
To write stories and post them on Wattpad, Fanfiction, and in the websites that he made by himself, making them on the PHP and HTML programming languages.<br />
(Wattpad is a website for people to write and read stories, for authors to post their stories and gain readers.)<br />
One day, Izaque was reading a really good and atmospheric story on the FimFiction website.<br />
It was about the My Little Pony cartoon and the Don't Starve game together, it was a crossover.<br />
He liked so much those two things, the game, and the cartoon, and those things together are better than them alone.<br />
There was one day where Izaque did not make a live stream, he was watching a movie called Avengers: Infinity War.<br />
Izaque was eating pizzas, hamburgers, and lots of Coca-cola cups while watching the two-hour movie.<br />
He loved to do that, watch that awesome movie, Izaque added the movie to his watched list on his website called Watch History.<br />
The boy added the movie on his website and movie text files on his computer using a Python script called Watch.py that he made.<br />
Izaque also used a program on his computer called Foobar2000, which was a Music Player, Izaque had 25 GBs of music on his SSD hard drive.<br />
He liked to have a lot of music stored on his SSD, and he called himself a Music Hoarder.<br />
Izaque was on a SubReddit about Music Hoarding, the description of the Music Hoarder SubReddit was:<br />
"Home of the music hoarders and audiophiles who are looking to expand, archive, or organize their music library.<br />
We also share methods of data/audio hoarding, piracy, access to private trackers, torrents, and much more."<br />
Izaque was also a friend of one of the founders of Think Outside The Box, he liked the new update they made to the LonelyShips.<br />
The Double-SpaceShip possibility, wall color change, LonelyShip Invite, and the equipment change, he liked all the new changes and new features.<br />
Izaque sure loved to be a LonelyShipper and to live in a LonelyShip, to live on the SpaceLiving SpaceShip Network.<br />
He even created a Discord Server about it and talked to a lot of friends on Discord about how to become a LonelyShipper.<br />
The boy wanted people to feel the happiness that he felt on his LonelyShip.<br />
<br />
One day, Izaque had an asteroid coming in the direction of his LonelyShip, then the security system activated and a big laser turret appeared at the top of his LonelyShip.<br />
It shot its laser beam towards the asteroid, destroying the asteroid completely.<br />
Izaque was not scared by the asteroid, because he knew that the LonelyShip would protect him from the asteroid.<br />
He loved to study and to learn about the LonelyShips, SpaceLiving, and the Think Outside The Box company.<br />
With the new update number 1.3.709, Izaque and the other LonelyShippers could visit their families, they were happy to see them again.<br />
Lisa did not want to see her family, she thought they would be sad about her, and missed her.<br />
But she got some courage and walked to her LST teleporter, she entered inside it and selected the location of the house of her parents.<br />
Her parents accepted her LST synchronization request, an LST teleporter already existed inside Lisa's parents' house.<br />
Lisa selected her parents' house on the LST screen, she teleported there to see her family again.<br />
Her parents were there, they started crying when they saw her there, they walked close to her to hug her.<br />
Lisa hugged her parents back, she thought about her brother.<br />
"First your brother comes back, and now you, I'm so happy my little flower," said Lisa's father, John.<br />
"My brother was here?" asked her.<br />
"Yes, he has been here some months ago, he started dating that girl that he told us, Monika, right honey?" asked John to Ana, Lisa's mother.<br />
"Yeah, he started dating her, then they started living in his... What was the name of it, hon? I can't remember that name," asked Ana.<br />
"It was some type of spaceship I think, they could live there together in space," said John, unsure of what he was saying.<br />
"Spaceship?" asked Lisa in a surprised voice, she thought about something.<br />
"I have to go back right now," said Lisa.<br />
"Why? You just arrived my little flower," asked John.<br />
"It's that maybe my brother lives on the same spaceship network that I live.<br />
And I'm sorry that I didn't get good grades, and never made you two proud of me, I'm sorry dad, mom.<br />
I'm sorry that I stopped going to school, and I was just locked inside my room, crying, I did want to eat anything," said Lisa, with a sad face.<br />
"Oh, it's okay my dear, we love you, even if you don't have good grades, and don't go to school," said Ana, hugging Lisa.<br />
"Yeah, we love you, Lisa," said John, who also hugged Lisa.<br />
"Now go find your brother, hehe," said Ana, smiling at Lisa.<br />
Lisa smiled again, looking at her father and her mother, "What is my brother's name?" asked Lisa.<br />
"Oh, it's Ted," said Ana.<br />
"Okay, thanks mom, dad, I love your two," said Lisa, who started walking to the LST teleporter of Lisa's parents.<br />
"We love you too," said Ana and John together, waving their hands to Lisa.<br />
Then Lisa entered the LST teleporter, she typed the code of her LonelyShip, which was #324.<br />
<br />
She came back to her LonelyShip, she got out of her LST teleporter and walked to her computer, turning it on.<br />
Lisa waited for the computer to boot, then she opened the Discord program, she also opened the SpaceLiving App on her computer.<br />
(Discord is a social network platform for gamers but non-gamers also use it.)<br />
The girl looked on the SpaceLiving App, searching for the invite link to the official Discord server of the SpaceLiving Network.<br />
She entered the Discord server and said hello on the main chat, then she clicked on the role channel.<br />
Lisa got some roles like wall color roles, additional things, furniture colors, the code of her LonelyShip, which was #324.<br />
She had the Blue Wall Color, Blue Furniture Color, and #324 roles.<br />
The girl started looking on the member list of the server, she was searching for her brother, Ted.<br />
The nickname of every LonelyShipper was their name on the Discord server.<br />
On Discord, you can have a user name like Izaque, and a code or discriminator like #5125.<br />
Someone can add you on Discord by combining your user name and your discriminator, like Izaque#5125.<br />
On Discord servers, you can change your user name only on that server, that is called a nickname.<br />
So Lisa could have a user name like LisaLS and a nickname like Lisa.<br />
She found the Discord profile of her brother, Ted, she clicked on it and sent him a friend request.<br />
After some minutes, he accepted the friend request, he said hello to Lisa.<br />
Lisa got up and grabbed a water bottle from her TPF fridge, she then sat at the chair of her computer, drinking some of the water.<br />
The girl put some calm music on the YouTube website to play.<br />
"Hello, how are you?" asked Lisa to Ted.<br />
"I'm good, how about you, Lisa?" asked Ted.<br />
"I'm good too, thanks for asking.<br />
Can I ask something a little personal?" asked Lisa.<br />
"Sure, go on," said Ted.<br />
"Okay... Do you have a sister?" asked Lisa.<br />
"Yes, I have one, though I don't remember her very well, how she was, it's been some time since I and her disappeared from the house of our parents.<br />
And it has been some time since I saw my parents too, some months ago, I was there at their house, I want to see my sister again," said Ted.<br />
"Oh, okay... Do you remember the name of your sister? Or how her appearance was?" asked Lisa.<br />
"No... I think she had gray hair, why?" asked Ted.<br />
"Just asking," replied Lisa, "So... I think I'm your sister," said Lisa.<br />
"What? How?" asked Ted.<br />
"My dad's name is John, and my mom's name is Ana, they said that my brother's name was Ted," said Lisa.<br />
<br /><img class="image_size border_4px border_color_cyan border_radius_8_cent box_shadow_black" src="https://thestake2.netlify.app/Images/Images/SpaceLiving/Lisa.jpg"" style="max-width: 50%;" /><br /><br />
"Okay, here it is," said Lisa, who sent Ted a photo of her.<br />
<a href="https://thestake2.netlify.app/Images/Images/SpaceLiving/Lisa.jpg" target="_blank" class="text_green_water text_hover_green_water">https://thestake2.netlify.app/Images/Images/SpaceLiving/Lisa.jpg</a><br />
"I can't believe it... Is that you? Lisa? Hmm... Can I visit your LonelyShip?" asked Ted.<br />
"Okay..." said Lisa, who sent her LonelyShip code to Ted.<br />
<br />
Then Ted walked to his LST teleporter, he got inside of it and typed Lisa's LonelyShip's code.<br />
After some seconds, he was on the LST teleporter of Lisa's LonelyShip, he opened the door and got out.<br />
"Hello... Lisa, sis," said Ted, looking at Lisa.<br />
Lisa got up and walked to Ted, she hugged him, "Brother..." said her, with her eyes closed.<br />
"Sis..." said Ted, hugging Lisa back, caressing her hair.<br />
After that, Lisa broke from the hug, "I remember mom saying something about us having two other sisters, do you remember that?" asked Ted.<br />
"Yes, I don't remember how they were, maybe they were too young when we disappeared right?" asked Lisa, who sat at the bed.<br />
"Yeah... I wish I could see them again, last time I was home they said that one of them moved to another city.<br />
And that the other one was still in Los Angeles," said Ted, who also sat at the bed.<br />
"Oh, I wanted to see them again, maybe we should go home and try to find them, ask mom and dad, what do you think brother?" asked Lisa.<br />
"I think that's a great idea, sis, hehe, let's do it in a few weeks, okay?" asked Ted.<br />
"Okay, hehe," said Lisa, Ted hugged her again, "I'm so happy to see you again," said Ted.<br />
"Me too, brother," said Lisa, smiling.<br />
"I'm sorry that I stopped going to school, and started getting depressed, sad, just locked inside my room, and didn't want to eat," said Lisa with a sad face.<br />
"It's okay sis... I should have tried more, to help you, I was weak... I'm sorry that I didn't help you..." said Ted, also sad.<br />
"No, it's okay brother... it was me that was weak, and didn't notice the state that I was in, I should have tried more to make you, dad, and mom happy..." said Lisa.<br />
"It's okay... I think you're better now, you received this gift, which is this LonelyShip, and you can live better here, and I'm happy for you, I love you, sis," said Ted.<br />
"I love you too, bro, hehe," said Lisa, they were still hugging.<br />
"Aren't you gonna tell me about your girlfriend?" asked Lisa.<br />
"Oh, yes, hehe, she is called Monika, and she has brown hair, she is very cute and I love her.<br />
I met her on Discord, hehe, some years after I got teleported to my LonelyShip," said Ted.<br />
"Can I meet her?" asked Lisa.<br />
"Sure, hehe, how about tomorrow?" asked Ted.<br />
"Tomorrow sounds great, hehe," said Lisa.<br />
"Okay, hehe, I'm gonna go back to my LonelyShip okay sis?<br />
Monika left the LonelyShip to visit her parents in Los Angeles and to transfer her house to her sister.<br />
I'm gonna go to Earth to visit mom and dad, today is the day of visiting your parents, hehe, because of the new LonelyShip update," said Ted.<br />
"Okay bro, tell mom and dad that we met each other again and that we want to find our two sisters," said Lisa.<br />
"Okay, I'm gonna do that, sis," said Ted.<br />
"What is the name of Monika's sister, bro?" asked Lisa.<br />
"It is Sayori, she is gonna transfer her house to Sayori because she moved to our LonelyShip.<br />
And Monika is gonna add her house as a trusted house in our LonelyShip," explained Ted.<br />
"Oh, okay bro," said Lisa.<br />
Then Ted got up and walked to Lisa's LST teleporter, he opened the door.<br />
"Goodbye, sis," said Ted.<br />
"Goodbye, bro," said Lisa, then Ted entered inside the LST teleporter and typed the code of his LovelyShip, he teleported to there.<br />
Lisa walked to her computer and opened a live stream of the game GTA V to watch.<br />
<br />
Izaque missed his family, he used the LST to make an LST synchronization request, to teleport to his parents' house.<br />
The boy appeared there and hugged all of them, his sisters, his brother, his father, and his mother.<br />
He was used to being on Earth and talking to humans, even if he had spent a lot of time inside his LonelyShip.<br />
Izaque asked if someone wanted to live there with him, but no one wanted, he was sad about that.<br />
Then he said "See you later" to all of them, he walked inside the LST teleporter that was in the house of his parents.<br />
And teleported back to the LonelyShip, a robot female voice greeted him, "Welcome back, Izaque," said the voice.<br />
It was the voice of the LSAI that Izaque had, he changed the gender and name of the default LSAI.<br />
The LonelyShip of Izaque already had a lot of good equipment, a good screen with a 144hz refresh rate, a PS4.<br />
Izaque was happy about his LonelyShip, he liked to eat delicious food from his TPF fridge, watch anime, movies, cartoons, series, videos, and play games on his computer.<br />
He wanted to talk more with Lisa, and other Discord friends that he had.<br />
The boy wanted to live more inside of his LonelyShip, he had a great life, did not needed to work, had free food and a free computer.<br />
Izaque was a little tired, he listened to some Dubstep music on his computer.<br />
Then watched an episode of the anime Eromanga-sensei while eating chocolate cookies.<br />
Izaque knew that Lisa liked that anime because it reminded her of her older brother.<br />
Lisa told Izaque that she remembered about her brother, visited her parents, and her brother visited her.<br />
Izaque was happy for Lisa, he sent her a message on Discord, he said he was watching Eromanga-sensei.<br />
"I love that anime, hehe, hey Izaque...<br />
I think you're a great person and a great friend.<br />
I'm happy to be your friend, hehe, you're gentle and caring.<br />
So... Thanks for being my friend, Izaque, I appreciate it," said Lisa with a smiley emoji.<br />
"Oh? Hehe, thanks, Lisa, I also like to be your friend, I'm very happy and grateful for that.<br />
You're a good friend, and gentle too, you're interesting, creative, and fun, hehe ^^.<br />
I still want to write a story with you, hehe," said Izaque.<br />
"Oh, hehe, we have to write one then, and thank you for all of those compliments ^^," replied Lisa.<br />
"Yes, hehe, I'm gonna go to bed right now, good night, Lisa," said Izaque.<br />
"Good night, Izaque ^^," said Lisa.<br />
He added the episode of Eromanga-sensei to his watched list using his Python script called Watch.py.<br />
Then, Izaque turned off his computer, he laid in his bed to sleep.<br />
The LSAI turned the lights of the LonelyShip off, Izaque started to sleep.

		It was a beautiful day in the SpaceLiving world, even if there was no sun close to the LonelyShips.<br />
Lisa, Izaque, Fred, Ted, and Monika were all inside their LonelyShips, living happily, using their computers, eating, and drinking.<br />
Lisa was drawing a little while watching an anime called "Eromanga Sensei", she felt inspired by that because it had a girl that drew too.<br />
She was happy drawing while watching her favorite anime, it was funny, cute, happy, she loved it.<br />
The anime tells the story of a little sister that draws erotic drawings and an older brother that writes stories and light novels.<br />
She draws the covers of the light novels of her brother, using the name Eromanga Sensei.<br />
But her brother does not know that she is Eromanga Sensei, she is called Sagiri, or Izumi Sagiri, and stays locked in her room every day.<br />
Her brother, Izumi Masamune, goes to school and works too, Masamune always leaves Sagiri's breakfast and lunch on her door and leaves the house to go to school or work.<br />
Sagiri's mother was the second wife of Izumi Kotetsu, and she became Masamune's stepmother.<br />
After some episodes, Masamune discovers that Sagiri is Eromanga Sensei, and they start to get closer again.<br />
They became distant when Sagiri's mother and Masamune's father passed away in an accident.<br />
Lisa loved to watch that anime, she was re-watching it for the twenty-third time, she was sad about seeing the two brothers be so distant.<br />
She had it download in Full HD quality on her computer SSD, just to watch again and again.<br />
The anime reminded her of her older brother, she loved him very much, she missed him.<br />
But then she got depressed, sad, and just wanted to stay in her room, he was sad about that, and they were now distant just like Masamune and Sagiri.<br />
She was hungry all day but did not have the motivation to eat.<br />
Lisa just stayed in her room, the lights were dimmed out, she was doing things at her computer.<br />
Then she reached a point in her life that she was weak and skinny, she realized that her life was bad.<br />
Lisa wanted to get out of there, she was afraid, she wanted to go to school just to make her parents happy.<br />
Her family was sad about her, she wanted to get out of there, when she slept, was 05:12 in the morning.<br />
She was sleeping in her bed and had a dream, a dream where she got teleported to a spaceship that had white walls.<br />
A Computer, PS4, a fridge that created any food you thought about called the TPF fridge, a bed, a wardrobe, and a smartphone on the table.<br />
The computer that it had was very fast.<br />
She thought that was incredible and awesome, to have all the things you need to use the computer.<br />
To have food and water when you want, and to have a super-good computer.<br />
(The LSAI and the LonelyShip tutorial did not exist at that time.<br />
So this initiation teleport does not represent the most current and modern SpaceLiving initiation, using the LSAI, the Artificial Intelligence of the LonelyShip.)<br />
She wanted to stay there forever, her eyes were shining bright.<br />
Everything was new to her, she got closer to the table and turned the computer on passing her finger in front of the button on the computer case.<br />
It loaded a modified version of the Windows 10 operational system, it was as if she had formatted the computer, she typed the name of the user.<br />
A password, and then the Windows 10 home screen appeared, it had Mozilla Firefox, Spotify, Windows Explorer, and the SpaceLiving Desktop App installed.<br />
The version of the modified Windows 10 was called Windows 10 (SpaceLiving Edition).<br />
She opened Firefox, the home page was DuckDuckGo, a search engine similar to Google.<br />
The bookmarks of the browser were DuckDuckGo, YouTube, Facebook, SoundCloud, Super Animes, Wattpad, and MyAnimeList.<br />
DuckDuckGo is a search engine, YouTube is a video website of Google, Facebook is a social media website from Facebook, SoundCloud is a music website, Super Animes is an anime website.<br />
Wattpad is a story website where you can post and read stories, and MyAnimeList is a website where you can create an anime list of watched, plan to watch, watching, on hold, and dropped animes.<br />
She opened the YouTube website and logged in to her account.<br />
The spaceship, called LonelyShip, would help her get more weight and more nutrition, it would make a diet for her, using the TPF fridge.<br />
The diet would create food that in reality were nutrients, the diet of nutrients that Lisa needed to get healthy.<br />
<br />
Then Lisa opened DuckDuckGo and download the YouTube-DLG program, it was an app that she used on her computer on Earth to download videos from a lot of websites.<br />
The computer also had Steam installed, Lisa logged in to her Steam account.<br />
(Steam is software where you can download free and paid games to play on your computer.)<br />
She opened Windows Explorer, she saw that the computer had five SSDs, each one with 10TB of space.<br />
Her eyes shined bright seeing that because she only had 500GBs of hard drive size on her computer on Earth.<br />
She switched to Steam and told it to download all the games she had in her library.<br />
Then Lisa opened the Mega website, she logged into her account, and downloaded the app for computers, she installed it and set it to download all of her 2TBs of files.<br />
She was loving that, setting up and organizing her new space of work on her new computer.<br />
After letting Steam and Mega do their jobs, Lisa was a little hungry, she got closer to the fridge, and a screen that was attached to it lighted up.<br />
It showed a lot of text like if it was a tutorial on how to use the fridge, Lisa thought it was pretty intuitive.<br />
She learned how to use the fridge, she thought about pizza, then opened the fridge, and a slice of pizza was there.<br />
Lisa thought it was amazing, she closed the fridge, thought about a Coca-cola can, and opened the fridge.<br />
A can of Coca-cola was there, she grabbed it and closed the fridge.<br />
She came back to the computer table and laid the pizza plate and can of Coca-cola on top of the table.<br />
Lisa started organizing her Mega files, she liked to make websites, she had a website where she made the history of watched things, where she registered what she watched.<br />
The girl registered what she watched using a Python script called Watch.py.<br />
She downloaded some anime on a website called Super Animes, Lisa had downloaded the first episode of the anime called Eromanga Sensei.<br />
Lisa thought that it was interesting, and wanted to give it a try, to see if she would like it.<br />
She started watching it while eating the pizza slice and drinking the Coca-cola can, she loved doing that.<br />
Lisa added the episode to her Watch History and her AniCartoMovie text file, which listed all of the anime, cartoons, series, and movies that she watched, she cleaned her hands and her mouth.<br />
Then she realized that she forgot something, "Discord! I forgot about it," she thought, Lisa downloaded Discord and logged in to her account.<br />
She was so happy to download it again and use it, to be able to talk to her friends, she thought that was a dream.<br />
Lisa knew that Google+ was going to die soon, she was sad about that, but she was happy about starting that new but not-so-new life of hers.<br />
She had a special friend on Google+, that friend was called Funkysnipa Cat or Izaque in real life.<br />
He also said that he called himself Stake2 on the Internet sometimes.<br />
Lisa loved to talk with that friend, she opened Hangouts and asked for his Discord name and discriminator.<br />
Izaque gave it to her, she added him on Discord and they started talking, Lisa wanted to know him more.<br />
They talked a lot, and knew a lot more about each other, Lisa was happy by talking with Izaque.<br />
<br />
Lisa wanted to express herself better, and write something, she wanted to write words on her computer.<br />
Then she talked with Izaque about that, Izaque suggested that Lisa started writing stories.<br />
She liked the idea, Izaque said for Lisa to download Notepad++, he said that it is a good program for writing.<br />
Lisa downloaded the program and started her first draft of a story, she wrote for some minutes.<br />
She liked the result, then saved the file and sent it to her Mega cloud, leaving it on a folder named "Stories" on her notepad folder.<br />
Izaque said for her to post her story on Wattpad because it was a good platform for writers to post their stories.<br />
(Wattpad is a website for people to write and read stories, for authors to post their stories and gain readers.)<br />
Lisa created an account there and posted her story, the name of the story was "The Oddities of Nature".<br />
After waiting some time, Lisa reloaded the page and there were ten views in it and one comment.<br />
The author of the comment was "Stake2", she found that weird, Lisa switched to Discord and asked if Izaque had a Wattpad account.<br />
Izaque said yes, Lisa came back to Firefox to read the comment, Stake2 was complimenting the story of Lisa, she was happy about that.<br />
She liked the comment and replied thanking Stake2, she liked to know what Stake2 or Izaque thought about the chapter, and also to read his advice about writing.<br />
Then Lisa switched to Discord and asked for the link of the account of Izaque on Wattpad.<br />
Izaque sent the link to Lisa, surprisingly was Stake2, Lisa was really happy about that.<br />
She switched to Discord to thank Izaque for that, Lisa said she loved to write the first chapter.<br />
"I started like that, well, I wrote Desert Island, I wasn't really happy about that story, it was my first story, but that helped me start as an author," said Izaque.<br />
"I made Desert Island in 2016, when I was reading a cool futuristic story, I was happy about the feeling that writing gave me.<br />
Then I never stopped writing till today, I wanted to make people feel what I felt while reading that story", said Izaque.<br />
"Oh, I'm happy to know that, I love to write, hehe, I will read your story called 'The Life of Littletato', it seems good.<br />
I liked to know how you started writing, it's interesting.<br />
Thanks for teaching me a lot about writing Izaque, hehe, I appreciate it," said Lisa with a smiley emoji.<br />
"I don't think I know much, but thanks for listening, hehe, learning and saying that my knowledge was helpful to you ^^, I like you a lot Lisa :3," said Izaque.<br />
"I like you a lot too Izaque, hehe :3, you're a very good friend," said Lisa.<br />
<br />
Then Steam finished downloading all the games of Lisa, she wanted to play one of them, she opened the Grand Theft Auto 5 game to play a little.<br />
She had some mods installed, she loved to play that game, drive cars and stuff, make a mess in the city.<br />
Lisa played a little and stopped, she closed the game, she was hungry again, she got up and thought about a hamburger and a cup of Coca-cola.<br />
She opened the fridge and there was a hamburger on a plate and a can of Coca-cola there.<br />
Lisa downloaded an episode of the sixth season of the series called "The Walking Dead", she waited for it to be downloaded, then opened it on VLC Media Player.<br />
She thought was weird to eat while watching that series because a lot of zombies and corpses appeared on the screen.<br />
But she could not hold her hunger, she always eats while watching something, because eating while doing nothing is boring, right?<br />
It was sad to watch that series, sometimes people died, and you ended the episode being sad about them.<br />
But in other times, it ended mysteriously, with something untold, to happen on the next episode, and to leave the viewer waiting for another episode.<br />
She finished watching and eating, she added the episode to her Watch History website and text files using her Watch.py Python script.<br />
The girl felt tired, and she wanted to use the bathroom, she used it and came to her bed, she laid on her bed and tried to close her eyes.<br />
"Is this a dream? It looks very real to me..." wondered Lisa, thinking to herself, then she tried to pinch herself.<br />
She did not wake up, she was surprised by that, she wanted to live on that spaceship, her LonelyShip, forever.<br />
Then Lisa slept, waiting to spend more time on her computer, to eat, meet new people, new LonelyShippers that lived on the SpaceLiving Network.<br />
<br />
Now in present times...<br />
Izaque was in his LonelyShip, sat at the chair of his computer, he was watching an anime called Shingeki No Kyojin or Attack On Titan.<br />
He was on the fourth season, the first part of the fourth season, which was the final season.<br />
The second part of the fourth season would launch in January of 2022, Izaque was sad that he had to wait for more episodes.<br />
But he did not care much about that, as the fourth season already finished launching, and he was on the ninth episode, he still had a lot of episodes to watch.<br />
He finished watching the episode, then, Izaque registered the watched episode on his watched things text files using his Python script called Watch.py, it was him that sent that script to Lisa.<br />
The boy got up and stretched a little, he grabbed a water bottle from the TPF fridge, drinking some sips of it.<br />
Izaque stored the water bottle inside the TPF fridge and closed it, then he sat on the chair of his computer.<br />
He opened a game called Project Zomboid to play.<br />
Project Zomboid is an open-world survival horror video game in alpha stage development by British and Canadian independent developer, The Indie Stone.<br />
The game is set in a post-apocalyptic, zombie-infested world where the player is challenged to survive for as long as possible before inevitably dying.<br />
It was also one of the first five games released on the alpha funding section of the gaming portal Desura.<br />
He liked that game, the style of it, the camera and perspective, the soundtrack and ambient sounds, the way that the game made him feel.<br />
Izaque played the game for some time, as a character named Maria Ramirez, he was planning to move to a house up the street.<br />
His house had only one floor, and that house had two and had more space to store things.<br />
He wanted to level up his carpentry level to be able to build more crates to store things, it could store 50 KGs (110 pounds) of weight.<br />
Izaque played for some time, then he saved the game and closed it, he was very productive and searched a lot of houses for supplies and food.<br />
After that, Izaque was a little tired, it was 11 PM on his computer's clock, he turned the computer off and laid on his bed to sleep.<br />
He slept for some hours, the LSAI of his LonelyShip turned the spaceship lights off.<br />
<br />
Then, after sleeping, Izaque started dreaming, he was dreaming about a green field with beautiful flowers.<br />
Big chocolate bars were falling from the sky, and there were chocolate milk lakes that never got dirty.<br />
Izaque walked around the greenfield, seeing the grass moving, the cool wind, he laid on the grass to feel it.<br />
A donuts rain started, he ate some chocolate donuts that fell on his mouth.<br />
He got up and started walking to a house, it was a farmhouse, looked like it was abandoned.<br />
Izaque opened the door and entered the house, there were some wind chimes on the window, making a relaxing sound.<br />
There was a TPF fridge there, he found that weird, "How can a TPF fridge exist outside a LonelyShip?" asked himself.<br />
"Well, maybe the fridge can be taken outside of the LonelyShip somehow," thought him.<br />
He walked closer to the TPF fridge, opening it, there was a Coca-cola can inside it, he grabbed it and closed the fridge, getting out of the house.<br />
Izaque began walking around the land again, seeing the big chocolate bars, the donuts rain stopped.<br />
He wanted something salty to eat with the Coca-cola.<br />
Suddenly, a hamburger rain started, there were hamburger plates everywhere on the floor.<br />
Izaque sat on the ground and grabbed a hamburger plate, he started eating and drinking, it was delicious.<br />
It stopped raining hamburgers, he looked to his left and saw a girl with gray hair, he thought that was Lisa.<br />
She walked closer to Izaque and sat at his left, Izaque noticed that her hair was in reality blond, she grabbed a hamburger and started eating it.<br />
"It's delicious right?" asked Izaque, looking at the hamburger of the girl.<br />
"Yes, I love the taste of it," replied the girl, looking at Izaque.<br />
"What is your name?" asked Izaque.<br />
"I'm Ana, what's yours?" asked Ana.<br />
"My name is Izaque," replied Izaque.<br />
"I think Lisa told me that her mother's name was Ana and that she had blond hair," thought Izaque to himself.<br />
Then the dream of Izaque changed, he continued dreaming and sleeping comfortably on his bed.

		Another day on the SpaceLiving Network, a rumor about a group LonelyShip was circulating, four friends who were so close and knew each other so well.<br />
They were teleported to the LonelyShip together, this rumor was spreading quickly, and the residents of the SpaceLiving Network were talking a lot about it.<br />
They created theories and Discord servers, fake Discord accounts about it.<br />
There was also a story, created and written by a user on Discord and Wattpad, called JV (pronounced Jay V).<br />
It was about the actions and the life of that specific group in their LonelyShip.<br />
The name of the group was called The Master Kingdom, they were all Brazilians and talked in Brazilian Portuguese but also know English.<br />
Some people thought that JV was a resident of the LonelyShip of The Master Kingdom because the story had so many details.<br />
At some time, in 2020, the four friends sent messages on the official SpaceLiving Discord server.<br />
Their names were Nathan, James, Lily, and Sophia.<br />
One of the members sent a selfie of the group on the main channel of the server, it was Lily on her account.<br />
Lily and James were fighting behind Sophia, that was taking the photo.<br />
Sophia was taking the picture and Nathan was just headbanging to Dubstep music in the bed.<br />
The users that were looking at the main channel started to talk about it.<br />
"They are the rare group that was teleported to a LonelyShip together!" said one user.<br />
Fred was there too, "Oh, I would like to live in a LonelyShip with my friends, with more than one, not in a FriendShip", he said.<br />
"And that is me, headbanging to Dubstep in the bed," Nathan said.<br />
"I'm fighting with Lily behind Sophia," said James.<br />
"And I'm taking the picture with my smartphone," said Sophia.<br />
"This is the first pic of a LonelyShip, we never saw a picture of one, even if we already know how ours is," said a random user.<br />
"Yea, that's right, someone gotta tell Think Outside The Box about that," said Ted.<br />
"They already know about that, since they have enabled that feature, only for that specific group,<br />
So they should feel special," said a SpaceLiving Helper.<br />
"Oh, okay then, they should feel happy I guess," said Ted.<br />
"Yes," replied the SpaceLiving Helper.<br />
<br />
After some time, people stopped talking about them, and a member of the LonelyShip group began to stream on Twitch.<br />
Showed his things, how he wrote stories, and surprisingly, Nathan was also JV.<br />
And the story was real, the story was about the group of The Master Kingdom.<br />
The people watching the live stream asked a lot of questions to JV, what was his name, he replied that his name was Nathan.<br />
Lily, James, and Sophia entered the room of Nathan, one at a time, to present themselves to Nathan's viewers.<br />
The LonelyShip of The Master Kingdom or TMK for short had four rooms, one for each person.<br />
After a while Nathan closed the live stream, he wanted to sleep a little, he locked the door with his key and lay on his bed.<br />
(You have to lock your door in a group LonelyShip, right xD, if you don't you are likely to wake up with whipped cream on your face.)<br />
Sophia was sleeping too, Nathan dreamed a little, thinking that he loved to live there with his friends.<br />
<br />
On the next day, it was twenty-one, January 2020, 21/01/2020.<br />
Nathan woke up and opened his door, he turned on his computer and saw an announcement on the official SpaceLiving Discord server.<br />
It was a notification saying that on that day, at 6 PM, all LonelyShippers or LonelyShip residents were going to be teleported to a big spaceship.<br />
To make a party, also because of that specific event (the TMK group), for the LonelyShippers to know other LonelyShippers, and to celebrate something.<br />
It was to celebrate the First SpaceLiving Anniversary.<br />
Nathan told James, Sophia, and Lily about that, Lily said in Brazilian Portuguese:<br />
"Mas eles não podem simplesmente nos teleportar pra lá, e se alguém não quiser ir?" (But they can't just simply teleport us there, and if there's someone who doesn't want to go?)<br />
"Bom... Eles fizeram isso pra nós trazer pra cá kkkkk," (Well... They made that to bring us here xD.) said Nathan in Brazilian Portuguese.<br />
"Justo," (Fair enough), said Lily.<br />
<br />
After some time, it was 6 PM, the LonelyShippers looked at their computer clocks.<br />
They suddenly were floating and a blue light surrounded them, they appeared on the PartyShip.<br />
There were a lot of TPF fridges on that spaceship, treadmills, computers, big couches, big TVs, and beds.<br />
The floor, walls, and ceiling of the spaceship were transparent, they could see space, the Earth, the sun, the moon, and the spaceships of the network.<br />
Everyone looked at each other, Ted was close to Monika, Fred smiled at Lisa and Lisa smiled back, Izaque hugged Lisa and Lisa accepted the hug.<br />
Izaque talked a little with Lisa, Fred, Ted, and Monika, he loved to talk face to face with people he talked to through the Internet.<br />
Fred talked with Mark, who was there too, they talked about games and stuff and drank beverages from the TPF fridges.<br />
Lisa talked with her brother, Ted, and talked with his girlfriend too.<br />
"Hey, so you're my brother's girlfriend?" asked Lisa.<br />
"Yes, and you must be Ted's sister," said Monika.<br />
"Yeah, hehe," said Lisa, smiling.<br />
Lisa also talked with Fred about stories, asking how was his writing, and if he improved.<br />
The girl was so happy about that, everyone was chatting, it was an awesome sight, a lot of people with lots of stuff in common.<br />
Talking a lot and being in the same environment.<br />
Izaque was happy to talk with Lisa, he also talked with Lisa's brother, Ted, and they started to know each other a little more.<br />
He also talked with Monika, Ted's girlfriend, and Lisa's sister-in-law.<br />
<br />
Ted was hugging Monika, Lisa was close to Izaque, hugging him, and the TMK group was close to each other.<br />
Then a screen appeared on the spaceship, showing SpaceLiving Creator Izaque, and the interior of the MotherShip in the background.<br />
He began talking, and what he was saying appeared on the screen, like speech-to-text (STT).<br />
"Hello, I, creator of the TOTB, want to thank all of you, the LonelyShippers, for being here today, at this party and anniversary.<br />
Everyone who participated, everyone that lives inside a LonelyShip, LovelyShip, FriendShip.<br />
And some specific people... That live inside a... GroupFriendShip, everyone is important," said Izaque.<br />
At that moment, people who were not of the group "The Master Kingdom" looked at the four people in the TMK group.<br />
"And to know that I created those things, those beautiful spaceships that you guys are loving living in, that makes me very happy.<br />
The spaceships are lonely, but you are all here now, talking with each other, meeting new people, and making friends," continued Izaque.<br />
(If SpaceLiving was an anime or cartoon, then this would be the time where the camera would move from side to side, showing everyone together, looking at the screen where Izaque is.)<br />
"I'm also celebrating, in my LonelyShip, celebrating... One year of the SpaceLiving Network, I'm so happy to see all of you together, happy, smiling.<br />
Well, actually, the network was created on day eighteen, August 2016 (18/08/2016), so the network has three years and five months, counting from the beta version.<br />
But the TOTB became an official New World company on day twenty, January 2019 (20/01/2019), and that's the date of the anniversary of the network.<br />
Also, I'm happy knowing that I made you people happy, and probably not lonely today, I'm happy to give life to your thoughts.<br />
I'm happy and proud to make your wishes a reality and to provide the possibility of living how you want.<br />
And I'm so happy to write, live, and create things for the people that want them, so, thank you all, LonelyShippers," continued Izaque, smiling.<br />
"Aww, how cute, I'm so happy to live in the SpaceLiving Network", said Monika smiling, Ted looked at her and smiled too.<br />
"Thanks to everyone who read the 'SpaceLiving' story too.<br />
The author of it, SpaceLiving Izaque, Stake2, and Funkysnipa Cat.<br />
You're a good guy, and a smart guy, thanks for writing that story.<br />
You also have been in the SpaceLiving Network since the beta version.<br />
You were the first person I invited into this instance of the network, a veteran, hehe," said Izaque.<br />
Everyone in the PartyShip looked at SpaceLiving Izaque when network creator Izaque talked about him.<br />
"You're welcome man, it was awesome to find that the creator of the SpaceLiving Network is an Izaque too, a New World Izaque, hehe.<br />
I found out about that some days after the beta version started because you called me at Discord and told me," said SpaceLiving Izaque, that laughed a little.<br />
"Thanks for being in our PartyShip, having this big party with everyone.<br />
Thanks for everything guys, and we will continue to live like this, the LonelyShips and the SpaceLiving Network will continue to exist.<br />
Protect yourself from the asteroids, Dubstep is good, and be lonely!<br />
Well, that's a weird thing to say after the party right...<br />
Be alone after the party, but be happy.<br />
That's positive solitude, I feel it whenever I'm alone, I like it," finished Izaque.<br />
<br />
The screen disappears, and a button to teleport back to your LonelyShip appears close to each one of the people, Izaque and Lisa stayed talking there.<br />
Sophia, James, Ted, Monika, and Fred teleported back to their spaceships.<br />
Nathan stayed there, he was playing a game on a computer.<br />
"Não demora muito, Nathan," (Don't take too long, Nathan) said Lily, who teleported back to the GroupFriendShip.<br />
Izaque and Lisa talked a little about the SpaceLiving anniversary.<br />
"It was good right?" asked Lisa, smiling.<br />
"Yeah, it was pretty awesome, seeing everyone talking and being together, celebrating, drinking and eating, hehe," replied Izaque, smiling too.<br />
"I liked that too, hehe, even if I have some social anxiety..." said Lisa, a little sad, "It was cool to meet my brother's girlfriend," replied her.<br />
"Oh, you did very well today then, hehe, and it's good to see you in person," said Izaque.<br />
"Thanks, Izaque," said Lisa, smiling, "It's good to see you in person too, can I give you a hug?" asked Lisa.<br />
"Sure," replied Izaque, then Lisa hugged Izaque, he caressed her hair, "I love to be your friend, hehe," said Izaque, smiling.<br />
"I love to be yours too, hehe," said Lisa.<br />
Then they said goodbye to each other, Lisa and Izaque teleported back to their LonelyShips.<br />
After some minutes, Nathan turned the computer off and got off the chair, he pressed the teleport back to your LonelyShip button.<br />
<br />
Izaque was a little tired, he watched an episode of the second season of One Punch Man while eating Doritos and drinking Coca-cola.<br />
Then he registered the watched episode with his Python script called Watch.py.<br />
He opened Discord and started writing a message to Lisa.<br />
"Hey Lisa, would it be weird if I wanted to go to your LonelyShip to spend some time with you?" asked Izaque in the message.<br />
"No... After today, I think I'm cool with talking to other people and spending time with them, I already practiced you know xD," replied Lisa.<br />
"Oh, okay, I'll send you a teleport request then," said Izaque.<br />
"Okay," said Lisa, then Izaque turned his computer off, he wore his slippers and walked to his LST teleporter, getting inside of it.<br />
He typed Lisa's LonelyShip code there and sent a teleport request, Lisa accepted the teleport request that appeared as a notification on her computer.<br />
The notification said: "Izaque wants to teleport to your LonelyShip, accept?"<br />
Then Izaque was teleported to Lisa's LonelyShip, he opened the LST door and got out, "Hey Lisa," said him.<br />
Lisa rotated her computer chair in the opposite direction to see Izaque, "Hey, Izaque," said Lisa.<br />
She got up and he walked close to him, they hugged, after that, they broke from the hug.<br />
"So, what you wanna do?" asked Lisa.<br />
"I want to play a game with you," replied Izaque, who sat on the bed.<br />
"Oh, what game?" asked Lisa.<br />
"What do you think about Overcooked 2?" asked Izaque.<br />
"It's a great game, and it's fun, hehe," replied Lisa, "Do you like to play with the controller or keyboard and mouse?" asked Lisa.<br />
"It doesn't make much difference to me, I'll go with the controller," replied Izaque.<br />
Then Lisa gave him a PlayStation 4 controller, she opened the game Overcooked 2 using her GamePlayer.py Python script.<br />
It was a Python script that Izaque gave to Lisa, so she could use it to open her games and count how much time she spent playing them.<br />
"Oh, you're using GamePlayer, the Python script I gave to you," said Izaque, who was sitting on the bed.<br />
"Yeah, it's very useful, thanks, hehe," said Lisa, who turned the time counter of GamePlayer on.<br />
"No problem, hehe," said Izaque, Lisa opened the game and selected the first level of the first map.<br />
They started to play together, helping each other with making dishes and passing ingredients.<br />
Lisa had to cut the ingredients in another part of the map that was blocked by a table.<br />
Izaque had to give the ingredients for Lisa to cut, and also put the cut ingredients on a plate to deliver the order.<br />
They had to make sushi and sashimi because the Demon-Breads were invading the kingdom of the Onion King, and they were hungry.<br />
<br />
Then, they were tired of playing, Lisa closed the game and pressed CTRL+C on the console of the GamePlayer.py Python script.<br />
It registered the gaming time of Lisa and Izaque on Lisa's text files that had gaming times.<br />
They played for one hour and thirty minutes, "Hey, can you send the gaming time to me on Discord? I want to remember it, hehe," asked Izaque.<br />
"Sure, hehe," replied Lisa, who copied the gaming time text and sent it to Izaque on Discord.<br />
The text was "I played the game 'Overcooked 2' for 1 hour and 30 minutes, current time: 01:00 18/06/2020".<br />
"Hey Izaque, would it be weird if I wanted to sleep close to you, like friends?... Not like... Another thing..." asked Lisa, blushing while avoiding eye contact with Izaque.<br />
"N-No... It wouldn't be weird... I also wanted that," replied Izaque, blushing too.<br />
"Do you want to sleep right now?" asked Lisa, while looking at Izaque's eyes.<br />
"Yes," replied Izaque, "Me too," said Lisa.<br />
Then she turned the computer off, she moved the chair inside the table, it had a place for the chair to be put to free up space when not using the computer.<br />
Lisa walked to the LST teleporter, closed its door, then walked to the bed, laying on the right side of it.<br />
Izaque looked at Lisa and blushed a little, then he laid beside her, getting inside the blanket, Lisa also got inside the blanket.<br />
"Can I hug you, Lisa? I think we're gonna sleep better this way," asked Izaque, blushing.<br />
"O-Okay..." replied Lisa, blushing, who hugged Izaque and closed her eyes, Izaque caressed a little the soft hair of Lisa.<br />
The LSAI of Lisa's LonelyShip, Ana, turned off the spaceship lights, noticing that Lisa and Izaque wanted to sleep.<br />
Izaque was so happy, sleeping together with Lisa, feeling her smell, she was happy too.<br />
<br />
On the GroupFriendShip, Lily was sleeping already, it was one and a half AM, Sophia was sleeping too, she was dreaming about a world inspired by the game No Man's Sky.<br />
James was listening to some KPOP on his smartphone.<br />
Ted and Monika were sleeping too, sleeping together, hugging tight, they were happy because they were together.<br />
Fred was finishing the newest chapter of one of his stories, he would go to sleep after that because he was a little tired.<br />
Everyone was happy in the SpaceLiving Network, sleeping, living their lives, doing their stuff, doing what they love, eating, drinking, writing stories, watching, and playing.<br />
It was a good day for the SpaceLiving Network, the anniversary day of it.<br />
<br />
(I don't know when I wrote this chapter, but I finished revising it on 02/05/2021.<br />
I revised this chapter and removed some things from it.<br />
In the old version of this chapter, I wrote about a group that I had with three friends of mine.<br />
It was Drag, Manuh, Kendra, and me, it was called GDS.<br />
I replaced them with another fictional group called The Master Kingdom, with James, Lily, Sophia, and Nathan, respectively.<br />
I replaced them with a fictional group because I don't talk to them so often anymore, only with Manuh.<br />
And it makes me sad to think about them when I read the old version of this chapter.<br />
I also removed a character that was my friend in real life, I removed Wendy from the chapter that was the fifth one, and now is the sixth one, The SpaceShips update and the reunion of brothers.<br />
I wrote her into the story because she was a great reader of SpaceLiving, and I liked when she read it.<br />
But she stopped replying to me on Discord, I sent her a lot of messages and she did not reply.<br />
She said that she got tired of talking with me because I only talked about my stories and not something else.<br />
And after that, she stopped replying to me, I was very sad about that.<br />
I removed her from the readers' list of SpaceLiving, chapter six, and also removed the drawings that I made of her custom LonelyShip.<br />
But I still wrote about her in this chapter, on the author's notes.<br />
Sorry if I wrote a lot for you to read, I had to get this off my chest.<br />
I met Wendy on the Discord server of the Cellbit YouTuber, I was really happy on that server.<br />
I had people to talk to, until I got banned wrongfully, for nothing.<br />
And after I got banned, I went in there with a fake account, and they all said what they really thought of me.<br />
That I was needy, boring, annoying, weird, and all that stuff.<br />
They were saying and thinking things about me behind my back.<br />
That hurt me a lot you know... It made me very sad, knowing that there are only fake people on the server and the live stream of Cellbit.<br />
I don't hate Cellbit, but I hate every one of the people that are inside that server, and I hate the moments that I spent there...<br />
Thanks for reading ^^, sorry for my big and long vent or outburst...)

		It was a beautiful day in the SpaceLiving Network.<br />
Lisa, Izaque, Fred, Mark, Ted, Monika, Nathan, James, Lily, and Sophia were all inside their LonelyShips, living happily.<br />
Izaque was looking for "New World Things" on the Internet and Discord Servers.<br />
He was a LonelyShipper or a resident of the SpaceLiving Network but also liked to do "New World Stuff" on Earth.<br />
Izaque learned about this New World Theory in 2016, it was about a group of people that were changing the whole world.<br />
With holograms, soul-like body forms, beings, and laws, he made the documentation of New World and a website for it in 2019, before being teleported to a LonelyShip.<br />
And sometimes, he teleported out of his LonelyShip to do those New World stuff, to use holograms, not so many people used the New World technology at that time.<br />
To see the characters that he loved, his friends, of his favorite cartoon.<br />
Which is My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic, Izaque dreamed his entire life about being able to see them, hug them, to talk to them.<br />
The first time he saw them, with the possibility that New World has created for him, was two months before he was teleported to his LonelyShip, he hugged every one of them.<br />
Twilight Sparkle, Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, Rarity, and Applejack.<br />
He was so happy at that moment, he smiled every day, thinking about them.<br />
New World and the New World Government have created a portal to all of the visual things that humans have created, anime, cartoons, series, movies, and games.<br />
In 2017, it was discovered that every visual thing that humans created existed in an alternate universe.<br />
The universe of a specific anime existed inside a universe bubble that contained all of the universes of that anime.<br />
There were canonic universes, the universes that followed the storyline that the broadcast of the anime had.<br />
And non-canonic universes, where different things happened, things that did not happen on the broadcast version of the anime.<br />
Izaque loved to visit and talk with all his favorite characters, of MLP, Sword Art Online, Fairy Tail, To LOVE-Ru, Shingeki No Kyojin, Yuru Camp, Plastic Memories, and Eromanga-sensei.<br />
He liked to use the New World technology on Earth, and also live on his LonelyShip, he thought that the LonelyShip ran on New World technology, but TOTB said that was not true.<br />
Izaque was a little tired, he said to some Discord friends that he was going to take a nap, and he looked at the computer clock and noticed that it was five PM.<br />
He said good afternoon to his dear friends on Discord, then he turned off the computer and lay on his bed.<br />
<br />
SpaceLiving Izaque was dreaming, he was a kid in that dream, a kid named Izaque Bulkan.<br />
He was eating dinner with Ana Bulkan, his sister; Rosa Winston Bulkan, his mother; and Fred Bulkan, his father.<br />
This Izaque is the Izaque Bulkan of my story called <a class="text_light_brown" href="https://thestake2.netlify.app/The Story of the Bulkan Siblings/en/" target="_blank">"The Story of the Bulkan Siblings"</a>.<br />
<a href="https://thestake2.netlify.app/The%20Story%20of%20the%20Bulkan%20Siblings/en/" target="_blank" class="text_green_water text_hover_green_water">https://thestake2.netlify.app/The%20Story%20of%20the%20Bulkan%20Siblings/en/</a><br />
I will call him Bulkan Izaque, because his surname is Bulkan, and he is from the Bulkan story (nickname of the story).<br />
He loved his family, Bulkan Izaque loved to go out on adventures with Ana Bulkan and Fred Bulkan.<br />
In one specific adventure, the boy got a golden Infinity Gauntlet with stones in it, he have known that the last user of this gauntlet was Thanos (Avengers: Infinity War).<br />
Bulkan Izaque loved to use his gauntlet, to protect his family, the gauntlet had the power to create portals, travel to another dimension, and fire elements.<br />
One night, everyone but Bulkan Izaque was sleeping, he grabbed his gauntlet and got out of the house.<br />
The boy used the mind stone to gain knowledge, he knew about the cartoon "My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic", and that the cartoon existed in another universe.<br />
He walked to a tall mountain, the moon was big behind him, just like a movie, he looked to the house of his parents and thought of Ana.<br />
The boy looked at his Infinity Gauntlet, thinking about the universe of "MLP: FIM", he had a vision about that universe and knew that another version of him loved that place.<br />
Someone like him but from another universe, he felt that the memories of another Izaque were leaking into his mind.<br />
He opened the portal by snapping his thumb and index finger together, it was a portal with purple borders, then he entered the portal and closed it.<br />
It was his first time in another universe, he transformed his gauntlet into two normal, black fingerless gloves, and made himself invisible.<br />
He looked and analyzed the creatures of that place, they were ponies.<br />
In the universe of "My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic", there was a land called Equestria, where the ponies resided.<br />
Bulkan Izaque imagined himself like a pony, he transformed into one with a green mane, blue skin, with some orange marks on his body, he also had wings, and he became visible.<br />
A pink pony approached him, he was scared, she appeared out of nowhere, and he did not want to draw too much attention there.<br />
"I've never seen you here in Ponyville, are you new here?" the pink pony asked in a sharp, shrill voice.<br />
"My name is Pinkie Pie and I am the receptionist, party planner, and cupcake cooker of town, what's your name?" asked Pinkie Pie, putting her snout on Izaque's snout.<br />
Bulkan Izaque was scared and surprised about how that pony could talk so fast, it was hard for him to understand all those words in so little time.<br />
"Uh... My name is Izaque and yes, I'm new here, I don't want to live here, you know... I'm just a visitor, can I talk to..." said Bulkan Izaque, thinking about something.<br />
At that moment, Bulkan Izaque moved his right hoof to his back and used the hidden gauntlet to know a little about that universe.<br />
All of the information about the universe of "My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic" appeared in his mind, like a flash of a movie.<br />
If he was in a cartoon, his eyes would show a lot of pictures quickly, showing all the memories and knowledge that he just got.<br />
It looked like he was stealing or copying the knowledge that the Izaque of Planet Earth in 2020 had in his brain about the "My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic" universe.<br />
"Twilight Sparkle?" asked him, finishing his sentence, the moment that he got the knowledge lasted only some seconds.<br />
"Oh, you wanna meet my friend Twilight, right? I'll take you to her," said Pinkie Pie.<br />
"Thanks a lot! Hehe," replied Bulkan Izaque, smiling.<br />
They both walked to the Castle of Friendship or the Crystal Castle, and Pinkie Pie knocked on the door.<br />
Twilight opened the door, "Oh, hey there Pinkie Pie," said Twilight, she turned her head to Bulkan Izaque.<br />
"Hey... I think I know you, you have an aura of someone I know... Can I look at you... More closely?" asked Twilight, while getting close to his face.<br />
Bulkan Izaque blushed while looking at Twilight, "W-Well, maybe I guess, hehe..." said him, feeling that he was starting to sweat a little.<br />
<br />
"Well... I'm gonna leave you guys alone," said Pinkie Pie, who started walking away from them, she disappeared in a second, Bulkan Izaque found that weird.<br />
Twilight Sparkle began to mumble while analyzing him, "You remind me of Izaque... A human that comes here sometimes," said her, looking at Bulkan Izaque.<br />
"I fear you're a version of him from another universe, what are you doing here, and why are you a pony? How did you even get here?" asked Twilight.<br />
"Well... I just wanted to visit this universe, I felt that another version of myself loved this universe, so I traveled here.<br />
I'm a pony because I have a magical item that gives me the ability to transform myself into anything, I got here by that same magical item," explained Bulkan Izaque.<br />
"Man, I have to go back, I learned through the Izaque of 2020 that one day in this universe is one year in my universe, I hope that's a myth," thought Bulkan Izaque to himself.<br />
"Oh... And what magical item that would be?" asked Twilight, curiously.<br />
"Can I go in? I can't show that in public," whispered Bulkan Izaque to Twilight.<br />
"Sure... Come in," said her, Bulkan Izaque walked in and Twilight closed the door of the castle.<br />
"It's this thing here," said Bulkan Izaque, while transforming his fingerless gauntlets back to the Infinity Gauntlet.<br />
Twilight's eyes shined when she saw the beautiful, sheeny Infinity Gauntlet with stones on the finger parts, she wanted to touch it.<br />
The gauntlet had six stones in it, one was blue, was the space stone, one was yellow, the mind stone, another one was red, the reality stone.<br />
There was also the purple stone, which was the power stone, and the green and orange stones, which were the time and soul stones, respectively.<br />
She moved her hoof close to the Infinity Gauntlet.<br />
Bulkan Izaque moved the gauntlet closer to him, "H-Hmm... Sorry, this gauntlet is very special to me, I use it to protect my family," said him.<br />
"Oh, okay... I just wanted to know more about it," said Twilight, a little sad.<br />
"I found it on a temple, it was inside a golden chest, sitting close to a big sleeping dragon and a blue sword.<br />
I didn't find it here, of course, I found it in my world, in my universe, which is called Gladius Fixous," explained Bulkan Izaque.<br />
"And also, I gotta go... I knew by the Izaque that goes here often that one day in here is like one year in my universe, I don't know if that's true, but..." said Bulkan Izaque.<br />
"Oh, it's okay, maybe you could come back here and explain to me how the gauntlet works?" asked Twilight.<br />
"Well, even I don't understand it fully, but sure, I could go back here sometime.<br />
And I like to feel the love that the other Izaque has for you, the New World Izaque, and the Normal Earth Izaque, it's good," said Bulkan Izaque, smiling.<br />
"Hehe, yeah, I know that he loves me, and I love him too, I feel happy when I'm with him, hehe," said Twilight, smiling too.<br />
(The New World Izaque is the New World version of me, Old World Earth Izaque is me, who is writing right now.)<br />
<br />
"That's good, hehe, so... I gotta go Twilight, sorry, I'm gonna leave this brown jewel here, so you can remember that I'm gonna come back," said Bulkan Izaque.<br />
"Oh, okay..." said Twilight.<br />
Then Izaque created a brown jewel with the letter "I" written on it and dropped it on the floor, he opened a portal back to his universe.<br />
The portal had brown borders and a dark core, it showed the big and shiny moon on the mountain that Izaque was before coming to Equestria.<br />
"Bye, Twilight," said Bulkan Izaque smiling.<br />
"Bye, Kid Izaque," said Twilight smiling back.<br />
He crossed the portal and was back in his universe, his world, on the same mountain, Bulkan Izaque closed the portal by using the Infinity Gauntlet while he was a pony.<br />
Bulkan Izaque transformed himself into a human again, it was still night, and the rumor that one day in Equestria was one year on Earth was just a myth.<br />
He started walking towards the house of his parents, he came inside the house and walked to his room, stored his gauntlet in the golden chest, and slept again.<br />
SpaceLiving Izaque thought that the dream was very real, and that it truly happened, that he was seeing the vision of Bulkan Izaque.<br />
Then the dream of SpaceLiving Izaque changed to something else, he was dreaming about a game called No Man's Sky.<br />
He was talking with a friend of his, a being of the Korvax species, looking at his multi-tool, to see if it was good to purchase.<br />
Fred was writing one of his stories on his computer, he wanted to finish that chapter quickly because he was a little sleepy and tired.<br />
He finished the chapter and sent it to Lisa, she liked the chapter and told him to post it on Wattpad, he posted and received a lot of comments.<br />
Fred was too tired to reply to them all, he ate two chocolate crackers and drank a cup of water, then laid on his bed and slept.<br />
<br />
Everyone at the SpaceLiving Network was sleeping, it was eleven PM there, on everyone's clocks, Ted was sleeping together with Monika, hugging her.<br />
They always sleep hugging, Ted was dreaming about being the character of the survival game called Don't Starve, the character was Wilson.<br />
He walked a little at the grassland, and gathered some grass and sticks, he already had some logs in his inventory, and he made a campfire with rocks.<br />
After that, he put five logs into the campfire, cooked a pork chop, and ate it.<br />
Then he walked a little far to check some traps that he had made to catch some rabbits, three of them had rabbits trapped inside them.<br />
Ted picked up the traps and finished all the rabbits, then walked back to his campfire and cooked the three rabbits, and stored them in his fridge.<br />
Monika was dreaming of being a computer file, she was inside a game, in that game, there were five characters along with her, Sayori, her sister, Yuri, Natsuki, and Izaque, the main character.<br />
She thought that the dream was really weird, it seemed too real, she knew that it was a game, but the other characters did not.<br />
Monika knew that Izaque, the main character, was a real person, from the outside world.<br />
<br />
In the SpaceLiving Network, a video was becoming famous on the Internet, it was a video that Izaque posted, he recorded his LonelyShip and made a tour through it.<br />
He showed his powerful computer, his TPF fridge, how it worked, how the buttons of the LonelyShip worked, and what the windows showed.<br />
Izaque said it was a beautiful LonelyShip, with orange walls, he said he loved to live there, alone, to chat with the other LonelyShippers.<br />
Everyone on the Internet was shocked after seeing the LonelyShip in a video, the people from Earth did not know what a LonelyShip looked like inside.<br />
Lisa was listening to some Synth-pop songs that she had downloaded, she wanted to talk a little with Izaque on Discord.<br />
Izaque woke up, he wanted to drink some chocolate milk, he got out of bed and opened the fridge, his beautiful, quadrangular, red cup was there, with some chocolate milk.<br />
It was cold, and the smell was good, the color, very balanced, he surely loved that cup, it was his favorite cup on Earth.<br />
Izaque also grabbed a plate with a piece of French bread, it had cheese and ham inside it.<br />
Then he turned his computer on and put to play a calm ambient song mix on YouTube to listen to while he ate and drank.<br />
After eating, he registered his eating time using his Python script called "Set Food Time.py", it added thirty minutes to the current time, and also added three hours.<br />
So then Izaque could know when he could drink water and when he would be hungry again.<br />
Then, Izaque put to play whatever he was listening to the last time he used the computer, on SoundCloud.<br />
It was a rock song, the volume was so high that he spilled the chocolate milk on the floor and table, "Shit!" shouted him, angry.<br />
"I gotta grab the laser cleaner," said him, placing the red cup on a part of the table that did not have chocolate milk.<br />
He picked up the laser cleaner on top of the TPF fridge, cleaning the chocolate milk on the table and floor.<br />
The laser cleaner was a tool that TOTB created to clean things quickly and easily, you could just activate it and point it to the thing you want to clean.<br />
It would shoot a streak of laser at the thing and remove it, it was configured to remove only dirty things, like spilled liquids, dust, dirt, and out-of-container food.<br />
Out-of-container food is food that is not on a plate, cup, bowl, or another thing to store food.<br />
The LonelyShip also had lasers below the table to clean your hands after eating.<br />
And also gloves that glue the food crumbs on them and you can remove the gloves easily, putting the hands on a blue holographic square below the table.<br />
He cleaned the spilled chocolate milk and placed the laser cleaner on top of the TPF fridge.<br />
Izaque listened to a calm song while drinking his chocolate milk and checking his social media, the name of the song was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIEd71mViM" target="_blank">"Panda Eyes - Take My Hand Ft. Azuria Sky (Z∆NE Remix)"</a>.<br />
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIEd71mViM" target="_blank" class="text_green_water text_hover_green_water">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIEd71mViM</a><br />
Some people liked and commented on his stories on Wattpad, and he replied to all of them, thanking his readers, then replied to his messages on Facebook and Discord.<br />
He liked to know that his dear friends had sent messages to him, he was so happy to see them every day, even if it was not physically.<br />
For him, was awesome to see their faces, or profile pictures every day.<br />
But sometimes he felt too suffocated because of the feeling that he has to reply to all of the seven social media that he uses.<br />
<br />
Sophia woke up and wanted to eat something sweet, she got up and grabbed a marshmallow that was inside the fridge.<br />
She ate it and loved it, then she wanted to listen to some rock on her computer, she put it to play.<br />
Sophia was just like Izaque, headbanging to rock just like he headbanged to Dubstep.<br />
Lily and James were still sleeping, they were dreaming about a lot of things, James dreamed about visiting some KPOP artists.<br />
Then about playing a game on his smartphone, Free Fire, he liked to play that game.<br />
Lily dreamed about living with Brendon Urie from the band "Panic! at the Disco", she loved him.<br />
Monika was dreaming about living in the world of the game "No Man's Sky".<br />
These LonelyShippers sure do dream, right? xD.<br />
<br />
(I wrote this chapter on 07/10/2019.<br />
And finished revising it on 22:13 03/05/2021.<br />
I loved to write about SpaceLiving Izaque dreaming about Bulkan Izaque.<br />
And I loved to write about Bulkan Izaque, the Izaque of my story called <a class="text_light_brown" href="https://thestake2.netlify.app/The Story of the Bulkan Siblings/en/" target="_blank">"The Story of the Bulkan Siblings"</a>.<br />
I'm sure he'll visit more universes of my stories sometime soon xD.<br />
I liked to write about Bulkan Izaque visiting the "My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic" universe and talking with Pinkie Pie and Twilight Sparkle.<br />
I also liked to talk about the New World Izaque, and the Normal Earth Izaque (me).<br />
Hehe, I liked to talk about the daily routine of the SpaceLiving Izaque, getting up, grabbing some chocolate milk and bread with cheese and ham.<br />
Listening to songs and stuff, checking out his social media, replying to comments on Wattpad.<br />
And I revised this chapter while listening to the soundtrack of the "Tom & Jerry" movie from 2021:<br />

<br />
Then they broke from the hug, Lisa and Littletato looked at each other.<br />
"I'm happy to see you again, sister," said Littletato.<br />
"Me too, sis, I'm sorry if I disappeared suddenly when you and I were little," said Lisa, a little sad.<br />
"Oh, it's okay sis, speaking of that, why did you disappear? What happened?" asked Littletato, curious.<br />
"I don't know, I was just playing with Ted in the backyard, mom and dad were inside the house, mom was making lunch.<br />
Then, a blue light surrounded us, it was weird, I looked at Ted in fear.<br />
We began to float, it felt good and gentle for me, it was soft.<br />
After some seconds, I saw Ted disappearing, I disappeared too, I appeared inside a weird spaceship with white walls, which is my LonelyShip now.<br />
Then I passed through the SpaceLiving Initiation, the LSAI explained to me how the LonelyShip worked, and what was the SpaceLiving Network," explained Lisa to Littletato.<br />
"Oh, I understand, do you remember when that was?" asked Littletato, curious.<br />
"I think it was in 2016, I had fourteen, you had sixteen right?" asked Lisa.<br />
"Yes, sis," replied Littletato.<br />
"So let's go to Ted's LonelyShip?" asked Lisa, looking at Littletato.<br />
"Okay, hehe," said Littletato, then Lisa walked to the LST teleporter with Littletato, they entered the teleporter.<br />
Lisa closed the LST door and typed the code of Ted's LonelyShip on the screen of the LST, Ted accepted the teleport request.<br />
A blue light filled the LST, after some seconds, they were teleported to Ted's LonelyShip.<br />
Littletato and Lisa got out of the LST teleporter, Ted got out of his chair, he walked close to Lisa and Littletato.<br />
"Hey nii-chan, this is Littletato, one of our older sisters, and this is Ted, your brother," said Lisa to Ted and then to Littletato.<br />
"Hello, Littletato, so you're my sister, right?" asked Ted, looking at Littletato.<br />
"Yes, and you're my little brother, Ted, right?" asked Littletato, who walked close to Ted.<br />
"Yeah," replied Ted, Littletato hugged Ted, "I missed you so much... Little brother," said Littletato, who closed her eyes.<br />
"I missed you too, sis," said Ted, with his eyes closed.<br />
<br />
Then Ted broke from the hug, looking at Littletato.<br />
"I guess Lisa already explained to you how we disappeared, right?" asked Ted.<br />
"Yes, should we go to our parents' house?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yeah, let's go," said Lisa, "That sounds good," said Ted, smiling.<br />
"Wait, so this is one of your older sisters?" asked Monika, who was laid on her bed, looking at the trio.<br />
"Yes, honey, hehe," said Ted, looking at Monika, smiling.<br />
"Oh, I'm glad you found her, honey," said Monika.<br />
Then Monika got up, she walked to Ted, Lisa, and Littletato.<br />
"Hey, I'm Littletato, and you must be Ted's girlfriend, right?" asked Littletato, raising her hand for Monika.<br />
"Yes, I'm Monika, nice to meet you, Littletato," replied Monika, shaking Littletato's hand.<br />
"Nice to meet you too, Monika," said Littletato.<br />
"So, honey, we're gonna go to my parents' house, okay?" asked Ted to Monika.<br />
"Okay, hon, travel safe," said Monika, smiling at Ted.<br />
"Thanks, hon," replied Ted, smiling too.<br />
"I think we gotta call our other sister too," said Littletato.<br />
"Oh, who is our other sister?" asked Lisa, curious.<br />
"She is called Carol, she has blond hair, and has nineteen, she lives in Los Angeles, the city where our parents live, right?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yes," replied Lisa and Ted in unison.<br />
"So, I'm gonna go back to my LonelyShip, set her house as a trusted house, and I'm gonna teleport to there.<br />
Then I'm gonna explain to her everything, and ask her to come with me, so we can go to our parents' house, okay?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Okay, hehe," said Lisa, "Okay, sis," said Ted.<br />
After that, Littletato walked to the LST teleporter of Ted's LonelyShip, she entered inside it, closing the door and pressing the "Teleport To My LonelyShip" button.<br />
<br />
Littletato was inside her LonelyShip, in the LST, she got out and walked to her computer, turning it on, it was five AM.<br />
She sat at the chair, opening the SpaceLiving App on Windows 10 (SpaceLiving Edition).<br />
The girl clicked the LonelyShip - LS tab, clicking on the Manage Things button, she then clicked on the Add button.<br />
Littletato clicked on the Electronics button, there were various buttons there, one for computers, one for mouses, one for keyboard, one for headphones.<br />
There was one for smartphones too, she clicked on it, the first smartphone was hers, she clicked on it, a modal appeared, showing the information of the smartphone.<br />
Littletato clicked on the Add button, a hole on the wall appeared, throwing her phone out, landing on the table.<br />
She picked her phone up, turned it on, and typed her password, all of her apps and things were there.<br />
The girl opened her WhatsApp, clicked on Carol's contact and begin to type a message.<br />
"Hey, sister, we gotta talk, do you remember that dad and mom told us about a brother and a sister that we had?" asked Littletato.<br />
"You must be sleeping right now, sorry for messaging you so late," said Littletato in a message, then she waited for some minutes.<br />
"Hey, sis, yes, I remember that they told us that, they said that our brother and sister disappeared at a young age, right?" asked Carol in a message.<br />
"Yes, they said that, so, I found them..." said Littletato, who got up and walked to her TPF fridge, opening it and grabbing a water bottle.<br />
"What? Are you kidding me?" asked Carol, shocked.<br />
"No, I'm not kidding, you remember that mom and dad said that one had gray hair and the other brown?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yes, what about it?" asked Carol.<br />
Then Littletato asked Lisa to send a photo of her and Ted on Discord.<br />
After some minutes, Lisa sent her a photo of Lisa and Ted together.<br />
Littletato opened Mozilla Firefox, then she opened WhatsApp Web to open her WhatsApp on her computer.<br />
She downloaded the picture that Lisa had sent her, then she sent that picture to Carol on WhatsApp.<br />
"What? Who are they?" asked Carol when seeing the photo.<br />
<br />
"They are Lisa and Ted, our siblings, Lisa has gray hair, and Ted has brown hair," replied Littletato.<br />
"I gotta meet them, sis," said Carol, "I remember them, we played a lot together when we're kids," continued her.<br />
"Okay, hmm... I met them when I was sleeping this night, and I got teleported to a spaceship called LonelyShip.<br />
I knew about the SpaceLiving Network, which is a network of spaceships and stuff.<br />
Then I met Lisa and Ted here, on the Discord server of the SpaceLiving Network," explained Littletato.<br />
"So, Lisa and Ted are in one spaceship?" asked Carol.<br />
"Yes, and you gotta come to my spaceship, I'll add your house as a trusted house, so I can teleport from my spaceship to your house, okay?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Okay, add it then," said Carol.<br />
Then Littletato walked to her LST, she clicked on the "Add New Trusted House" button on the LST's screen.<br />
After that, she selected the location of Carol's house on it, sending the LST synchronization request to Carol's house.<br />
Carol got up, she walked to her kitchen, a hologram appeared there, asking for the response of Carol to Littletato's LST sync request.<br />
She pressed on the accept button, then, a little robot with wheels appeared there, it walked to a corner of the kitchen.<br />
The little robot auto-destructed itself, leaving his body parts on the ground, the parts moved to the corner of the kitchen, they floated and generated the second LST.<br />
After that, there was a message on Littletato's LST, saying that the synchronization was successful, she pressed the Teleport button.<br />
A blue light surrounded Littletato on the LST teleporter, after some seconds, she appeared on the LST teleporter of Carol's house.<br />
Littletato opened the LST door and got out of it, walking to Carol, hugging her.<br />
"Hey, sis, it's been some time since I saw you, it's good to see you again," said Littletato, smiling.<br />
"It's good to see you too, hehe," said Carol, smiling, who broke from the hug.<br />
Then Littletato explained everything to her, about Lisa and Ted, the LonelyShips, and the SpaceLiving Network.<br />
<br />
"So, let's go, sis," said Littletato, "Okay, sis," said Carol, it was six AM.<br />
They both walked to the LST teleporter that was in Carol's house, they entered inside it, side by side, Littletato typed the code of Ted's LonelyShip and pressed the Teleport button.<br />
Ted accepted the teleport request, Littletato and Carol got teleported to Ted's LonelyShip, they got out of the LST.<br />
Carol walked close to Ted and Lisa, "Hey... Are you two Lisa, and Ted? The siblings that I had and forgot about?" asked Carol.<br />
"Yes, and you're Carol, our sister, right?" asked Lisa, looking at Carol.<br />
"Yes..." said Carol, who hugged Lisa, then Ted, they hugged back and smiled.<br />
"Now I remember about you two, we used to play lots of games together, right?" asked Carol.<br />
"Yeah, we played a lot of video games, basketball, rugby, football, and PlayStation 2," replied Ted, smiling.<br />
"Oh, you're Carol, the other sister," said Monika, who walked close to Carol, shaking her hand.<br />
"Nice to meet you, Carol, I'm Ted's girlfriend," said Monika, smiling.<br />
"Nice to meet you, Monika, I'm happy that my brother got a girlfriend, hehe," said Carol, smiling too.<br />
Then Monika walked to her computer, she sat on the chair.<br />
"So, let's go to our parents' house?" asked Littletato, looking at Lisa, Ted, and Carol.<br />
"Yeah," replied Carol.<br />
Then Littletato and Carol entered the LST of Ted's LonelyShip.<br />
"You two gotta go first, we're not gonna fit inside the LST all together," said Lisa, looking at Littletato and Carol.<br />
"It's okay, sis, the LST expands when there's a lot of people wanting to teleport," said Ted, looking at Lisa, walking to the LST.<br />
"Really?" asked Lisa.<br />
"Yeah," replied Ted, who put his feet inside the LST, the LST expanded to the left of Ted and the front.<br />
There was room for Lisa and Ted to go, the door was far left.<br />
Ted stayed on the right of Littletato, Carol was on the left of her, looking at Lisa.<br />
Lisa entered the LST, on the right of Ted, she selected her parents' house on the screen of the LST, which was on her right.<br />
"See you later, love," said Ted, "See you later, hon," said Monika, who was in her computer.<br />
The LST's door closed, a blue light began to surround the foursome.<br />
The LST of the house of Lisa's parents expanded to the left, where there was free space, to accommodate four people side by side, it was seven AM.<br />
<br />
After some seconds, Lisa, Ted, Littletato, and Carol appeared on the LST of their parent's house, the door opened.<br />
John and Ana, the parents of the foursome, were eating breakfast, they looked to the expanded LST.<br />
They were shocked and gaping, seeing the four children of them, all grown up, there, together.<br />
The foursome got out of the LST, looking at John and Ana.<br />
"My God, look at that, honey," said John, looking at the foursome.<br />
"Yes... My children, all here..." said Ana, smiling, who got up to hug Littletato and Carol, she hugged them.<br />
"And my children that disappeared..." said Ana, sad, looking at Lisa and Ted, she hugged them too, tight.<br />
Lisa and Ted explained what happened to them, how they disappeared, what was the SpaceLiving Network, and the LonelyShips.<br />
Listen to this while reading this part:<br />

They all sat at the table to eat breakfast together.<br />
"The family is reunited again..." said Littletato, looking at everyone.<br />
Everyone smiling, talking, Lisa talking with her parents, Ted too, Littletato and Carol catching up.<br />
Talking about what they did recently, and refreshing their memory about the forgotten ones, Lisa and Ted.<br />
Littletato was very happy, seeing her family united again, seeing Lisa and Ted again.<br />
She liked to have that family, she was smiling, seeing everyone.<br />
<br />
(And it's in mood that I end this chapter, listening to this song here, I recommend you listen too, to be in the same mood as I am:<br />

It's been a great journey to revise all of the chapters of "SpaceLiving", from one to ten.<br />
And to revise the chapters of <a class="text_light_salmon" href="https://thestake2.netlify.app/The Life of Littletato/en/" target="_blank">"The Life of Littletato"</a>, from one to twenty-six.<br />
It feels like this journey is ending, with that song, but it's not.<br />
There are still five chapters of SpaceLiving for me to revise, and three chapters of <a class="text_light_salmon" href="https://thestake2.netlify.app/The Life of Littletato/en/" target="_blank">"The Life of Littletato"</a>.<br />
And I can also write more chapters for them, and other stories of mine, for you to read.<br />
Thank you for reading this far, and reading my stories.<br />
Today is 04/05/2021, a Tuesday, of the year 2021.<br />
I love to write stories, create art, create things, give life to things that I love.<br />
I love to revise my stories and to write them, I'm glad that I have this talent or ability.<br />
I am Izaque, Stake2, and Funkysnipa Cat, thank you for your attention.<br />
See you later, cheers :3.)

		Monika was talking to her sister on Discord, she was called Sayori.<br />
She remembered when she transferred her house to Sayori when she started dating Ted.<br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony:_Friendship_Is_Magic" target="_blank">"My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic" on Wikipedia</a>)<br />
"Hey Monika, I'm fine, how about you?" asked Sayori.<br />
"I'm good too, just living here in the LovelyShip with my boyfriend Ted.<br />
It is a double spaceship that is a copy of a single spaceship, so couples can live together," replied Monika.<br />
"Oh, that's interesting, I got a part-time job with Yuri, my friend, it is in a library, I like reading and literature, hehe," said Sayori.<br />
"That sounds very good sis, good luck with your job! What about Yuri?" asked Monika.<br />
"Thanks, sis! Well... She liked the job because she loves books, so I guess it's a really good job for her.<br />
And I think she can find someone who likes the things she likes too, someone she can relate to," said Sayori.<br />
"That's good, hehe, I'm gonna leave to play a game right now, sis, talk to you later," said Monika.<br />
"Oh, okay sis, good gaming, ttyl," said Sayori.<br />
<br />
Izaque got a notification from a bot of the Discord server of the SpaceLiving Network saying that a new LonelyShipper has arrived.<br />
He had eighteen years old at that time, in 2020.<br />
"Hello @Funkysnipa Cat#XXXX, a new LonelyShipper has arrived!<br />
It would be good if you could greet them and explain to them about the SpaceLiving Network and the LonelyShips.<br />
Thanks for your help! From the SpaceLiving Volunteer Helper Notification Bot :3," said the SpaceLiving Volunteer Helper Notification Bot on Izaque's Discord.<br />
Izaque then opened a Direct Message with the new LonelyShipper on Discord, she was called Luiza.<br />
Luiza had sixteen years old in 2020, she would have eighteen in 2022, and lived in the city of Maringá, in Paraná, Brazil.<br />
"Hello, I'm an Administrator at the SpaceLiving Discord server, they told me that you're new here, so, do you need help with anything? ^^" asked Izaque in his message to Luiza.<br />
Her user name was Luíza_Master, "I wanted to know where I am, where all of this came from, and who's the owner of this rabbit?" asked her in her message.<br />
"This spaceship is called a LonelyShip, it is hovering some kilometers away from Earth, if you look through the left window you will see Earth.<br />
This bunny was given to you because you were sad before being teleported to the LonelyShip, and the spaceship thought about giving a pet to you, to make you happier.<br />
Don't worry, if you want to go back home you can enter inside the LST, which is the blue thing that looks like a bathroom box behind you.<br />
And you and click on the 'Teleport Back Home' button inside the LST or LonelyShip Teleporter.<br />
The spaceship teleported you because it felt your desire about living alone, only with a computer, food, a bathroom, and other things.<br />
This happened with me and with everyone at the Discord server too," explained Izaque in his message to Luiza, he used the Funkysnipa Cat username on Discord.<br />
Luiza looked out the window and thought about Earth for a little, about everything she went through there, everything she suffered, and every moment that she was sad.<br />
She decided something and walked to the computer, starting to type on the shiny keys.<br />
"I want to stay... I don't wanna go back to Earth anymore..." said Luiza in her message to Izaque.<br />
"I'm happy for you, I can assure you will be much happier here, I hope I have helped you, do you still have questions?" asked Izaque.<br />
"Yeah, how this spaceship... The LonelyShip works?" asked Luiza.<br />
"Well, there's the LonelyShip Teleporter, which can teleport you back to Earth, or the LonelyShips of other residents of the network.<br />
There's the Thought-Powered Fridge or the TPF fridge, that can create any food you think of.<br />
There's also the computer, the powerful computer where you're talking with me right now, you can open the SpaceLiving App that is on the start menu of Windows 10.<br />
It has an icon that is the letters S and L, you can manage your LonelyShip there, customize the diet that your TPF fridge generates, and get a new mouse, keyboard, screen, and hard drive.<br />
You can also get clothes, furniture, personal hygiene stuff, pets, home appliances, you can also paint your LonelyShip walls and the furniture colors," explained Izaque.<br />
"Oh, thanks for the explanation, hehe, it's very good to know that, and now I can eat without having to work, that's awesome!" said Luiza.<br />
"Yeah, it's pretty good, isn't it? Hehe, can we be friends?" asked Izaque.<br />
"Well, if I'm gonna stay alone here with... The bunny, then yes, we can be friends," replied Luiza.<br />
"Oh, that's good, hehe, I'm happy then, what's your name?" asked Izaque.<br />
"My name is Luiza, nice to meet you, what's yours?" asked Luiza.<br />
"Nice to meet you too, Luiza, my name's Izaque," replied Izaque.<br />
<br />
"So, what do you like to do on the computer? ^^" asked Izaque.<br />
"I like to listen to Future Bass music, play some First Person Shooter games, talk a little, write some stories sometimes, I like to study too.<br />
How about you?" asked Luiza.<br />
"Well, I like to read, write stories, program/code, make websites, draw, edit videos, watch anime, cartoons, series, movies, videos, play games, listen to music.<br />
I like to help new LonelyShippers who arrive at the SpaceLiving Network, talk to people sometimes," replied Izaque.<br />
"Oh, that's pretty interesting, can you show your stories to me sometime?" asked Luiza.<br />
"Yeah, just ask me, hehe.<br />
I love to show this New World to people because I love to live in it, the SpaceLiving Network.<br />
The company that created the network was so gentle and caring to create this network for teens.<br />
Do you know the name of the company that created the SpaceLiving Network?" asked Izaque.<br />
"No, which one?" asked Luiza.<br />
"It's called Think Outside The Box or TOTB," replied Izaque.<br />
"How do the families of the people of the SpaceLiving Network feel like?" asked Luiza.<br />
"I think they get sad, but some don't care, because they don't care about the person... Like they abandoned them, but they still live with them...<br />
They receive a hologram message on their house, telling them that their relative is on a LonelyShip of the SpaceLiving Network.<br />
You can eat what you want in the TPF fridge, but your relatives can send you special food if they want, just let them know.<br />
Like a special food exclusively cooked by your grandma or mom that you love," explained Izaque.<br />
"Oh, I understand, hehe, thanks for explaining that.<br />
I think I'll like it here, it seems my dream has finally come true, without the problems of others surrounding me..." said Luiza.<br />
"That's very good, Luiza, this was my dream too, about living alone... Without listening to my parents' sounds, they put loud videos on their computers and phones.<br />
And I have to use headphones so I do not get distracted by them," explained Izaque.<br />
"Oh, I feel sorry for you, Izaque..." said Luiza.<br />
"It's okay, hehe, I'm here right now, living the LonelyShip dream, hehe, like the American dream xD," said Izaque.<br />
"Yeah, hehe, that's better ^^," said Luiza.<br />
"I think there's a boy who writes stories about the SpaceLiving Network and the LonelyShips, maybe this boy is me xD, just maybe..." said Izaque.<br />
"Really?!" asked Luiza, a little surprised.<br />
"Yes, haha xD, the TOTB company talked about me on the First SpaceLiving Anniversary.<br />
You can see the video of the anniversary message by going on the Discord server and clicking on the #spaceliving-anniversary-videos text channel on the server," explained Izaque.<br />
"Oh, I'll look for that on the Discord server then, hehe, I'd love to read your story someday," said Luiza.<br />
"I'd love to send it to you, hehe, there are already some chapters published on the website, do you want the link?" asked Izaque.<br />
"Yes, please," replied Luiza.<br />
"Here it is <a class="text_green_water" href="https://thestake2.netlify.app/SpaceLiving/en/" target="_blank">"SpaceLiving"</a>," said Izaque.<br />
<br />
"Thank you," replied Luiza.<br />
"No problem, hehe, thanks for wanting to read.<br />
I think on chapter five there's an invite to the SpaceLiving Discord server, but that's kind of useless since you're already on it," said Izaque.<br />
"So, who reads till chapter five, and is on Earth, can go to the SpaceLiving Network?<br />
If I had known that, I would have read your story before, hehe," said Luiza.<br />
"Hehe, well, no, I just send this story to someone that is already on a LonelyShip.<br />
But I think there are some Internet tutorials on how to be 'invited' to live on a LonelyShip," said Izaque.<br />
"I've never seen anything about it, I would have liked it a lot, to be here sooner.<br />
And to participate on the first anniversary of the network, by the way, when was it?" asked Luiza.<br />
"Me too, it was on the twenty-one of January 2020," replied Izaque.<br />
"Oh, it was just some months ago, maybe I'll participate next year, hehe," said Luiza.<br />
"Yeah, it would be good to have you there, it will be fun, hehe," said Izaque.<br />
"Yes, so, I'm gonna leave to play a game right now, see you later, Izaque ^^," said Luiza.<br />
"See you later, Luiza ^^," said Izaque.<br />

"Hey, sis, I'm thinking about buying a house, what do you think?" asked Littletato.<br />
"What do you mean, sis?" asked Lisa.<br />
"Like, buying a big house for me to live with my friends, and also you," replied Littletato.<br />
"Oh, I think that's a great idea, sis, I would like to live with you.<br />
Like, I have my spaceship, but I would like to add your new house as a trusted house in my LonelyShip.<br />
So I can teleport to you to spend some time with you, and visit you more often, hehe," said Lisa, she was smiling.<br />
"Oh, thanks, sis, hehe, I'm saving up some money to buy the house and storing the money in my bank account.<br />
And Júlia is working too, saving up some money on her bank account," said Littletato.<br />
"Really? Hehe, I hope you two get the money soon, good luck, sis!" said Lisa.<br />
"Thank you, sis, hehe, I'm working right now, I'm gonna go back to programming an app, okay? Laters sis ^^," said Littletato.<br />
"Oh, okay, hehe, laters, sis ^^," said Lisa.<br />

<br />
Izaque was on his LonelyShip, he was using his computer, listening to a song called "The Brig - Mind Changer".<br />
He was thinking about Luiza, his friend that also lives inside a LonelyShip, he wanted to talk to her again.<br />
And maybe visit her on her LonelyShip, even if he does not know her very well.<br />
Izaque was thinking of calling Lisa to visit his LonelyShip again, he remembered when he visited her LonelyShip for the first time.<br />
The boy opened Discord to talk with Lisa.<br />
"Hey, Lisa, what do you think about visiting my LonelyShip sometime?<br />
I visited yours after the First SpaceLiving Anniversary," asked Izaque in a message.<br />
"Yes, I think it would be great, I want to visit your LonelyShip to see how it is," replied Lisa.<br />
"You wouldn't be uncomfortable being here with me, right?" asked Izaque.<br />
"No, w-we even slept together when you were here," replied Lisa, sending a flushed emoji.<br />
"Oh, t-that's good I guess... Okay then, you can come anytime you like ^^," said Izaque.<br />
"Thanks, Izaque, tell me when you're free, hehe," said Lisa.<br />
"Okay, I'll tell you, I'm gonna do something else, see you later, my dear, I love you," said Izaque with a smiling emoji.<br />
"See you later, my dear, hehe, I love you too," said Lisa.<br />
Then Izaque continued using his computer, he watched an episode of Dr. Stone, he loves that anime.<br />
That talks about the human civilization being reconstructed by a boy called Senku.<br />
Humanity needs to be reconstructed because a weird and maybe alien ray petrified every human.<br />
<br />
Izaque felt tired, he wanted to sleep, he finished the episode of Dr. Stone.<br />
And then started watching an episode of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic while eating a slice of chocolate cake and drinking a Coca-cola cup.<br />
After some time, he finished watching that episode of My Little Pony.<br />
Then he lied on his bed and closed his eyes, sleeping while thinking about Lisa.<br />
Izaque dreamed about being a human in Equestria, he was Earth Izaque, a human that had golden wings made of lava fluid, a hand-grappling hook also made of lava fluid.<br />
He was also a half-human half-dragon, or a human hybrid of a dragon, he breathed fire and had lava instead of the normal human gastric acid on the stomach.<br />
The boy was in his room, his computer was there.<br />
He opened a purple portal to Equestria, the portal appeared inside the Crystal Castle of Twilight Sparkle, a pony princess of purple fur.<br />
Izaque steps out of the purple portal and talks with her.<br />
"Hey Twilight, how are you?" he asks.<br />
"I'm good, what about you, Izaque?" she asks.<br />
"Me too, long time no see right?" asks him.<br />
Then Twilight replies, "Yeah, but you're here now, and I'm happy because of that".<br />
He said that he was talking with a friend of his, a friend from a distant place.<br />
Izaque was sat on the blue comfy carpet that Twilight had.<br />
She stopped reading her book to listen to him and looked at him.<br />
"Her name is Littletato... I'm her creator, her father, you know...<br />
I wrote this story in 2017, it was called Littletato too, it was so awesome.<br />
I felt so happy writing it, I felt so incredible, it is still awesome to write that story," said Izaque.<br />
"Oh, that's very great to hear Izaque! I'm glad you're having so much fun writing it.<br />
Two thousand and seventeen was a long time ago on Earth, right?<br />
You're inspiring me to write a story Izaque! Hehe, that makes me so happy.<br />
I got inspired seeing that you still write your story to this day and are so dedicated to it," said Twilight Sparkle.<br />
"Yeah, it was a very long time ago.<br />
Well... Today right now on Earth it's the year 2019, so it was very long ago.<br />
I'm glad I inspired you to write something Twilight, hehe.<br />
If you need help just tell me okay? I'll be happy to help you write something," said Izaque.<br />
"I would love that, hehe, please teach me, Izaque-sensei (teacher Izaque in English).<br />
So... How did you speak with her? Was it good?" asked Twilight Sparkle.<br />
"Yeah, it was pretty good.<br />
Well... I think she saw the Littletato story on Wattpad and sent a comment saying that she was in that story.<br />
Then we talked a little through comments on the comment section of the first chapter of my story.<br />
After that, she asked for my Discord name and discriminator, I sent an Inbox message to her with my data.<br />
She added me and we started talking, she thanked me for everything that I did for her.<br />
Even if what I did was just create a story and make good things happen to her.<br />
I'm thankful for meeting her, and I'm happy that I created her story, she is my daughter.<br />
She calls me daddy, and I'm happy because of that..." explained Izaque.<br />
"Oh, that's a pretty good way of meeting someone, meeting them because you wrote a story about them," said Twilight, giggling a little.<br />
"I don't know what Discord is, is it a network that Discord created or something?<br />
How can you two connect that way?<br />
Sometimes I can't understand Discord..." said Twilight.<br />
"Well, Twilight, it isn't the Discord of Equestria, you know.<br />
Discord is only the name of a social network that exists on Earth.<br />
A technology network exists on a website where people can talk with each other and exchange messages.<br />
I also can't understand him, but he's cool and funny, I wanted to be weird and random like him," replied Izaque.<br />
<br />
"I also love Sword Art Online a lot, it was an anime on Earth that was launched in 2013, it was the first anime that I watched," says Izaque to Twilight Sparkle.<br />
"Wow! I would love to watch it with you, I bet it's really good, I also have things like that...<br />
Things that remind me of my childhood, oh... The wonderful books that I've read when I was a foal..." says Twilight, looking at the tall ceiling of the Crystal Castle.<br />
"It makes me happy just to think, Izaque... Never forget the things that make you feel happy, hehe, I love you Izaque..." says Twilight, smiling at Izaque, she hugs him.<br />
"I love you too, Twilight..." says Izaque, caressing Twilight's mane.<br />
After some time hugging, Izaque breaks from the hug.<br />
"Hey Twilight, I gotta go home, I'll visit you again, okay? I love you," says Izaque, kissing the cheek of the purple pony princess.<br />
"I love you too Izaque, see you later, hehe," says Twilight, kissing the cheek of the winged human-dragon hybrid back.<br />
Then Izaque creates another purple portal, getting up and crossing it.<br />
He goes back to Earth, closing the portal, he is in his room again, Izaque turns his computer on.<br />
He opens the Wattpad website and starts writing The Life of Littletato, a story that he loves to write a lot.<br />
Izaque thinks about his friends from the Internet, he loves them a lot, he loves to talk with them.<br />
Then he finishes writing the chapter of The Life of Littletato.<br />
Izaque names it "The beautiful Life of Littletato <3", chapter twenty-eight, he is so proud of writing that chapter because it makes him so happy.<br />
He thinks about his other story, SpaceLiving, he created it with a friend of his, Júlia, it now haves fifteen chapters, he loves writing it too.<br />
The Izaque from the SpaceLiving universe which is the Izaque that is having this dream right now is feeling all of these things.<br />
He is feeling the feelings of the Earth My Little Pony Izaque, the New World Izaque, the Bulkan Izaque, the Old World Earth Izaque.<br />
The SpaceLiving Izaque thinks that all of those feelings are weird and that the dream is weird too.<br />
SpaceLiving Izaque feels and sees how it is to be in the skin of Earth Izaque, Earth Izaque is eating a pizza right now, while watching The Walking Dead.<br />
He wakes up and sits in his bed, looking at the orange floor.<br />
Izaque thinks and associates all of that information.<br />
He wonders who is Earth Izaque, New World Izaque, who are the friends of Izaque, the people that Earth Izaque was talking with.<br />
SpaceLiving Izaque turns on his computer and opens Mozilla Firefox.<br />
Then he opens the Piskel app website, which is the website that he uses to make pixel art and drawings, even if he does not draw very often.<br />
He draws a pixel art of a default LonelyShip, after some hours of drawing, he finishes it.<br />
<br /><img class="image_size border_4px border_color_cyan border_radius_8_cent box_shadow_black" src="https://thestake2.netlify.app/Images/Images/SpaceLiving/LonelyShip Story Cover.png" style="max-width: 50%;" /><br /><br />
<br />
Izaque becomes very proud of that drawing, he even shares it with some friends of his on Discord, Lisa likes it a lot.<br />
The boy thinks about that story he dreamt of, The Life of Littletato, he knows that he never wrote it, he only wrote Kezzakam and SpaceLiving.<br />
He searches for it in Wattpad, he finds out that a user, Stake2, wrote The Life of Littletato, and Izaque uses that name through the entire Internet, he thinks that is weird.<br />
Izaque wants to sleep again, he is hungry too, he eats a slice of pizza and drinks a cup of Coca-cola, he turns off his computer and lies on the bed again, trying to rest.<br />
He wants to dream more too, to know about things of other universes, the universe of Earth Izaque, New World Izaque, Old World Izaque.<br />
Izaque thinks that the fact that a lot of other Izaques exist is weird.<br />
A visual list with texts appears in his mind, he thinks it is a dream.<br />
"Earth Izaque, New World Izaque, Old World Izaque, SpaceLiving Izaque, Dreamworld Izaque, Bulkan Izaque, Kingdom of Arstotzka Izaque, 'A Perfect World' Izaque,<br />
Omnipotent Izaque, Nothingness Izaque, Clone Network Izaque, Desert Island Izaque, Relaxing Sunny Days Izaque, Ascension To Equestria Izaque," shows the list.<br />
A weird list with a lot of Izaques, a lot of versions of him, a lot of universes, the multiverse.<br />
SpaceLiving Izaque thought that all of that information was a lot to digest, his head hurts, he thinks he haves to be an omnipotent being to understand that.<br />
He is still dreaming, a good and calm dream appears and he can have a good rest now.<br />
<br />
On Earth, Littletato thinks about buying a house to live in with her friends, she thinks of Júlia, and also her siblings, Lisa, Carol, and Ted.<br />
She talks with Júlia about that, discussing some things about the house, what it should have, and how many rooms should it have.<br />
Júlia says that she wants a house with seven rooms at least, so they can bring more friends and maybe their families to spend some time there.<br />
Littletato says that it is a good idea, she says that she is going to start searching for a house on the Internet tomorrow morning.

		It was a beautiful night at the SpaceLiving Network, it was ten PM on everyone's clocks, on the year 2020.<br />
Lisa was on her LonelyShip, she was watching some anime, watching the "Dr. Stone" anime because Izaque recommended it to her.<br />
"Dr. Stone" talks about the human civilization being reconstructed by a boy called Senku.<br />
Humanity needs to be reconstructed because a weird and maybe alien ray petrified every human.<br />
She was watching the last episode of the first season, there was also the second season, called "Dr. Stone: Stone Wars".<br />
Lisa was watching it while eating some Doritos in a bowl and drinking a cup of Coca-cola.<br />
It was very delicious to eat while watching and to watch that anime, she dimmed the lights of her LonelyShip to look at the screen better.<br />
After some minutes of watching, Lisa finished watching the episode, she registered it as watched on her files of watched things using the Python script called Watch.py that Izaque gave to her.<br />
She also registered the watched episode on the MyAnimeList website, which is a website for registering the anime you watch.<br />
Then she closed her web browser, Lisa opened Steam to play a game, she opened Project Zomboid to play.<br />
Project Zomboid is an open-world survival horror video game in alpha stage development by British and Canadian independent developer, The Indie Stone.<br />
The game is set in a post-apocalyptic, zombie-infested world where the player is challenged to survive for as long as possible before inevitably dying.<br />
It was also one of the first five games released on the alpha funding section of the gaming portal Desura.<br />
She liked to play that game, she continued playing as the female character Sarah Sanchez, who started the apocalypse on West Point, Kentucky.<br />
Lisa played for some minutes while using the GamePlayer.py Python script to count how much time she spent playing it, that Python script was also given by Izaque.<br />
Then she saved the game and closed it, stopping the stopwatch of GamePlayer, she played for thirty minutes and ten seconds.<br />
After that, Lisa closed Steam and turned her computer off, she placed the empty bowl and cup inside her TPF fridge, closing it.<br />
Lisa walked to her bed, lying on it, Ana, the LSAI of Lisa's LonelyShip, turned the lights of the spaceship off, Lisa slept.<br />
<br />
After sleeping for some hours, Ana started turning the spaceship's lights slowly and smoothly on.<br />
Lisa started to wake up slowly and naturally, she rested well, Lisa looked at her digital wall clock.<br />
It was six AM, she got up and walked to her bathroom, she washed her face with liquid soap and combed her hair.<br />
The bathroom of the LonelyShips had a hole on the wall that could be created.<br />
That hole was pointed to the sun, it had some specific technology to filter the light of the sun and let the LonelyShipper gather some Vitamin D.<br />
It also helped the resident of the spaceship to wake up because the sun had that biological power.<br />
The hole formed on the wall of the bathroom, Lisa started to brush her teeth while feeling the warmth of the sun.<br />
After that, she got out of the bathroom, closed its door, grabbed her two-liter water bottle from the TPF fridge, and drank some water.<br />
Then Lisa stored the bottle on the TPF fridge again, grabbing a plate with a cheese and ham sandwich, it also had mayonnaise and ketchup.<br />
Lisa clicked on the table button on the left side of the TPF fridge.<br />
A holographic table appeared on the left side of the fridge, Lisa left the plate with the sandwich there.<br />
Then she opened the fridge and grabbed the cup of chocolate milk that was there, placing it on the table too.<br />
Lisa moved her ergonomic wheeled chair close to the table, sitting on it, she started to have breakfast.<br />
After some minutes, Lisa finished eating, she placed the plate and the cup inside the TPF fridge, closing it.<br />
Then she moved her ergonomic chair back to the computer table, turned her computer on, and sat on the chair.<br />
The computer booted up, Lisa opened a Python script called "Register When I Ate".<br />
It was a Python script that registered when Lisa ate, added thirty minutes, and also three hours to that time.<br />
The thirty minutes were for knowing when Lisa could drink water, and the three hours were to know when Lisa would be hungry.<br />
The first text that the Python script showed was "This is the time that you ate: 06:31 18/08/2020".<br />
Lisa then opened the Mozilla Firefox browser, she opened the PicoWorkers website.<br />
It was a website where you could do small virtual jobs to earn some money.<br />
You could create your account and do jobs like upvoting a post on Reddit, watching a video on YouTube, or signing up on a website.<br />
Then you would provide some proofs that you made the job to the employer, you could be an employer too.<br />
You needed PayPal or one of the other two digital bank accounts accepted there to withdrawal the money, and you can only withdrawal if you have more than five dollars.<br />
Lisa had everything that she needed and wanted on her LonelyShip, but she also worked to store some money in her bank account.<br />
She wanted to have some money stored to use when she needed to buy something on Earth.<br />
Lisa had some dollars that she could earn, they were pending because the employers needed to review her job.<br />
She did some small jobs like the Reddit ones, upvoting the posts and sending the proofs of her job.<br />
The girl already had five dollars on PicoWorkers, she wanted to earn up to ten dollars to withdraw.<br />
After working for some minutes, her temporary task rate was low, she needed to wait for an employer to verify her job to be able to do jobs again.<br />
<br />
Then, after that, Lisa closed the PicoWorkers website, she opened Wattpad to check her notifications.<br />
Lisa then replied to some comments on her stories, thanking the readers and talking a little.<br />
After that, she closed the website and opened Discord to talk with some of her friends.<br />
Lisa replied to some of her notifications on Discord, she talks with Izaque too.<br />
"Hey, Zaq, how are you doing?" asked Lisa.<br />
"I'm doing pretty great, what bout you Li?" asked Izaque.<br />
"Me too, hehe, I was just checking Wattpad to see my notifications, hehe," replied Lisa.<br />
"Oh, really? Hehe, I did that too some minutes ago," said Izaque.<br />
"Yeah, hehe, I like writing in the morning too, it makes me happy.<br />
How is your daily routine, Zaq?" asked Lisa.<br />
"I wake up, wash my face, brush my teeth, drink some water, then I eat something.<br />
After that I open some websites of the Internet to check tasks like Habitica and Microsoft Todo, then I work a little on PicoWorkers," replied Izaque.<br />
"Oh, mine's the same, haha, thanks for showing me PicoWorkers! ^^<br />
I also register when I ate with the Python script you gave me, hehe," said Lisa.<br />
"No problem, hehe, I'm glad you find it useful, what you eat?" asked Izaque.<br />
"I ate a sandwich with cheese and ham and a cup of chocolate milk, what about you?" asked Lisa.<br />
"I don't like to drink milk, I stopped drinking it, and when I drink it, I get a headache, but they are nutrients, right? Even though I don't like the taste.<br />
I ate a toasted sandwich made with my mom's home bread, with cheese and seasoned shredded chicken, it was very delicious, hehe," replied Izaque.<br />
"Oh, your mom's home bread must be good, hehe, maybe you can send it to the food catalog of my TPF?" asked Lisa.<br />
"Yeah, I'll send it as a food gift, so you can prove it, hehe.<br />
I'm gonna leave to write a little Li, take care, laters :3," said Izaque.<br />
"Oh, okay, hehe, you too, laters Zaq :3," said Lisa.<br />
It was six and fifty AM, Lisa had her phone charging on the table of her computer.<br />
Her phone was white, it was the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, it has 12 GBs of RAM, 128 GBs of internal space, and 5.000 mAh of battery life.<br />
She received a message on WhatsApp from Littletato saying that she bought a mansion to live in with her friends.<br />
And asked if Lisa wanted to add her house as a trusted house on her LonelyShip.<br />
Lisa replied saying yes, she asked for the address of the house, then Littletato sent it.<br />
She also asked Lisa to tell Ted about that, Lisa replied saying ok.<br />
Then she opened the SpaceLiving App on Windows 10, she clicked on the LonelyShip Teleporter - LST tab.<br />
She clicked on the Add new trusted house option, then she opened WhatsApp Web on Mozilla Firefox.<br />
Lisa copied the address of Littletato's mansion and pasted it on the "Insert house location here" text field on the SpaceLiving App.<br />
She clicked on the Add button, after some seconds, a message showed that it was successful.<br />
Lisa then told Ted that Littletato had bought a new house, and told him to add her house as a trusted house.<br />
The girl also sent the address of Littletato's house to Ted through Discord.<br />
He added Littletato's Mansion as a trusted house.<br />
<br />
Littletato called everyone to the house, Iam, Carol, Vitória, Lisa, Ted, and Monika.<br />
Lisa, Ted, and Monika teleported to Littletato's house, everyone signed the Partnership Agreement.<br />
After that, Littletato told to Iam who everyone was, her sisters, brother, the sister of Júlia, and Monika.<br />
Ted and Lisa hugged Júlia and Vitória, they liked to meet them.<br />
Littletato and the others discussed who would do maintenance, repairs, how the property would be used, who would be allowed besides the owners.<br />
She also discussed with them the house rules and other things.<br />
"I'm so happy right now, owning a house with you guys," said Júlia, smiling while looking at them.<br />
"Me too, hehe, it looks fun," said Lisa.<br />
"So, Carol will mow the lawn, Vitória will take out the trash, Iam will fix broken windows and other broken things of the house.<br />
I and Júlia will take care of paying the bills, fees, the annual tax, we just need you guys to give a part of your money for us to pay the bills, okay?" asked Littletato.<br />
Then everyone replied positively, "Hey, we have enough space for our cars right?" asked Iam.<br />
"Yes, we have four garage spaces here, one for me and Júlia, one for Carol, Vitória, and you Iam, if we need more space there's always the yard," replied Littletato.<br />
Then Littletato decided what bedroom would be for who.<br />
"So, you guys can move when you're ready, we gonna move today, Vitória can do her job remotely right?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yeah," replied Vitória.<br />
"You too, right sis?" asked Littletato to Carol.<br />
"Yes, hehe," replied Carol.<br />
Then everyone got out of the house, they got their cars to go to their houses to bring their stuff.<br />
Lisa, Ted, and Monika teleported to their LonelyShips, they created some things with the Thing Creator, using the SpaceLiving App.<br />
They made a copy of their powerful computers to bring them to their bedrooms in Littletato's Mansion.<br />
Lisa and Ted also asked for a TPF Transformation Device, which was a device that could transform a normal fridge into a TPF fridge.<br />
They both got one and teleported back to Littletato's mansion.<br />
The LonelyShip Teleporter or LST of Lisa was in Lisa's bedroom on the mansion, Ted's and Monika's LSTs were in their bedroom.<br />
Lisa, Ted, and Monika placed the copies of their computers in their bedrooms.<br />
<br />
Littletato and Júlia drove back home, Lisa thought that they were going to grab their stuff at their house.<br />
After some minutes, they arrived there with a small truck, they started unpacking the things inside the house, it was eight and a half AM.<br />
Lisa and Ted walked to the big kitchen of the mansion, they looked at each other and the device in their hands.<br />
"Oh, you also thought in transforming the fridge into a TPF, hehe," said Ted, smiling.<br />
"Yeah, I think it would be great, hehe, to eat any food when you want," said Lisa.<br />
Then they both placed the devices on the sides of the two-door fridge, the devices looked like they were electrocuting the fridge.<br />
After some seconds, the devices disappeared and made a booming sound, Lisa opened the fridge thinking about a slice of pizza.<br />
There was a slice of pizza inside the fridge, Lisa looked at Ted and smiled, Ted smiled back.<br />
Littletato and Júlia walked to the kitchen, it was nine AM.<br />
"Oh, you guys are here, did you two finish bringing the stuff of your LonelyShips to here?" asked Littletato to Ted and Lisa.<br />
"Yeah, we finished, we just made a copy of our computers and brought them to our bedrooms," explained Lisa.<br />
"And also, test your new fridge, sis," said Ted.<br />
"What? But this fridge isn't new..." said Littletato, who walked to the fridge.<br />
"Open it while thinking of some food," said Lisa.<br />
"This can't be what I think it is..." said Littletato.<br />
Then Littletato opened the fridge while thinking of a chocolate cake.<br />
There was a chocolate cake on the fridge, Littletato smiled.<br />
"Oh, this is a TPF fridge, how did you do that?" asked Littletato, smiling.<br />
"We can ask for a device that transforms any fridge into a TPF," said Ted.<br />
"Yeah, we asked for it on the SpaceLiving App on Windows 10," explained Lisa.<br />
"Oh, thank you, hehe," said Littletato, smiling while hugging Lisa and Ted.<br />
Then Littletato and Júlia said bye to Ted and Lisa, they walked to their bedroom to unpack stuff.<br />
They started unpacking the bags and clothes.<br />
Lisa and Ted got back to their bedrooms, they turned their computers on.<br />
Monika was also using her computer, the bedroom of Ted and Monika had space for placing two computers.<br />
Lisa told SpaceLiving Izaque that Littletato had brought a mansion to live in with her friends.<br />
Izaque was very happy knowing that, Lisa also told Fred about that, he said that it was very cool.<br />
Monika told Sayori, her sister, that she started living in the mansion that a friend of her had bought.<br />
Sayori said that she wanted to go to San Francisco to visit her sister, Monika.<br />
Monika asked Littletato if Sayori could go there for a visit, she asked that through Vegesapp/WhatsApp, Littletato said yes.<br />
<br />
Lisa walked to the kitchen of the mansion, Littletato was there eating a sandwich and drinking chocolate milk.<br />
Then Lisa sat on the other side of the table, looking at Littletato.<br />
"When are Vitória, Carol, and Iam coming?" asked Lisa, drinking some sips of her water bottle.<br />
"Vitória said that she's going to take a flight back to New York to bring her stuff.<br />
Carol got her car and started driving back to Los Angeles to bring her stuff too, it was one and a half hours ago.<br />
Iam said that he had to buy some things before packing his stuff, I think he's gonna come soon," said Littletato.<br />
"Oh, I wanted to talk more to Vitória, she's cool," said Lisa, looking at Littletato.<br />
"Yeah, she is very cool, me, Júlia, her, and Iam made a barbecue together on a Sunday, just like this one," said Littletato, looking up, remembering that day.<br />
"It looks like it was very fun, hehe, I wanted to do a barbecue with you, sis," said Lisa, smiling while looking at Littletato.<br />
"Oh, let's make one with everyone then, what do you think, sis?" asked Littletato.<br />
"I think it's a great idea, hehe, I'm gonna go sleep a little, I'm a little tired.<br />
I had fun organizing my stuff, hehe, building my computer, and bringing some clothes," said Lisa, getting up.<br />
"Good lunch, sis," said Lisa, who kissed Littletato's cheek and hugged her.<br />
"Oh, thank you, sis, I love you," said Littletato, hugging Lisa back and kissing her cheek, smiling.<br />
"I love you too, hehe," said Lisa, smiling, who started walking back to her bedroom, she locked her door and laid on the bed, starting to sleep.<br />
Littletato had finished eating her sandwich, she still had half of her chocolate milk left to drink.<br />
She got up and walked to the living room, grabbing her phone, then she got back to the kitchen and sat on the chair.<br />
The girl created a group on WhatsApp and added every resident of the mansion there.<br />
Júlia, Vitória, Carol, Lisa, Ted, Monika, and Iam.<br />
Littletato had created another group called "The Rules of the Mansion", where only moderators could post, she made Júlia a moderator.<br />
She posted the rules of the house there, which bedroom was for who, who did the jobs of the housework, and other rules.<br />
The other group that she created was called "The Mansion of Littletato and Friends".<br />
After everyone was there, Littletato had to take a picture of everyone in the front of the mansion to set it as a picture of the group.<br />
Iam sent a message on the group, "Hey, I liked this group, hehe, thanks for making it Littletato,<br />
I'm gonna check the other group when I forget a rule.<br />
I'm getting there in a minute," said Iam on the message.<br />
<br />
Littletato sent a message to the chat group of the mansion.<br />
"Since we have the TPF fridge now, which generates food for us, we don't need to set someone to make food on each day," said Littletato in her message.<br />
"Oh, that's good, now we can eat any food any time, hehe," said Carol in the message.<br />
"When are you gonna arrive here, sis?" asked Littletato.<br />
"In thirty minutes I guess, I'm half of the way to San Francisco," said Carol on the group.<br />
Littletato copied her message talking about the food and the TPF fridge to the rules group, as a notice.<br />
Then she finished drinking her chocolate milk.<br />
She deleted her message talking about the food and the TPF fridge on the rules group.<br />
Littletato made an Announcements group to post the announcements of the mansion, she liked to be organized, only moderators could post there.<br />
She sent the message talking about the food and the TPF fridge there.<br />
The girl also sent a message talking about the Xbox One in the living room.<br />
She said that anyone can play on it, as long as they do not play on the Xbox Live account of another person.<br />
Littletato told them to add their Xbox Live accounts to the Xbox One when they arrive there.<br />
"The kitchen also has a dishwasher, so no one needs to wash dishes, the TPF fridge can also delete dishware, so it's better to use it.<br />
Also, I'll ask everyone to download the lock app, it is an app used to lock and unlock the door of the house.<br />
It was created by a company that creates digital locks for house automation.<br />
Please download the app and send me your IDs in private so I can permit your phones to unlock the house door," said Littletato in a message to the Announcements group.<br />
The girl blocked the screen of her phone and pocketed it, she left her cup on the TPF fridge for it to delete.<br />
After that, she walked to her bedroom, unlocking the door, entering inside it, and locking the door again.<br />
She left her phone charging on the wall socket, besides Júlia's phone, she laid beside Júlia to sleep with her, Littletato had a spare key for the room.<br />
<br />
Lisa, Ted, and Monika were also sleeping, they were tired of organizing their clothes and building their computers.<br />
Vitória was on her flight back to San Francisco.<br />
Carol was arriving in San Francisco, she was heading to Littletato's Mansion.<br />
Iam had finished organizing his stuff, he locked the door and laid on his bed.<br />
"Hey, I'm gonna sleep a little, I'm really tired..." said Iam in a message on the chat group.<br />
Carol had arrived at the mansion, she parked her car there, opening the trunk and bringing her stuff to her bedroom.<br />
Vitória arrived in San Francisco, she got a taxi to go to Littletato's Mansion.<br />
She paid for the taxi and got out of it with her luggage, walking inside the house and going to her bedroom.<br />
Carol got out of the house and locked her car, she got inside again and walked to her bedroom, then she started organizing her stuff.<br />
Vitória also started organizing her stuff.<br />
Littletato and Júlia were so happy to be able to live with their friends together in a mansion.<br />
It was a dream that Júlia had since chapter fifteen, I mean, since January of 2019.<br />
And this is a big change in the life of Lisa, Ted, Monika, Littletato, Júlia, and all of the other residents of Littletato's Mansion.<br />
Let's see what this new journey will bring.<br />
<br />
(This was a cross chapter with The Life of Littletato, chapter twenty-nine, 29 - The Mansion of Littletato and Friends.<br />
I loved to write this chapter, it was written, not revised, I started and finished writing it on 19/06/2021.<br />
It was very good to write it, to write about Lisa's routine on her LonelyShip, to write about her talking with Izaque on Discord.<br />
And also to write about her, Ted, and Monika going to Littletato's Mansion.<br />
It was a little easy because I just copied some text from the chapter of The Life of Littletato.<br />
I adapted it a little, removing some stuff that Lisa couldn't see as if it was being told from her perspective.<br />
I wrote this while listening to calm rain on YouTube, it is a little cold in here where I live, raining sometimes.<br />
But in this chapter, it was warm with the sun, like it was in the summer.)

		It was a beautiful day on the SpaceLiving Network, it was a Monday, and everyone was doing their things, spending time on their LonelyShips.<br />
It was day twenty-one of January 2021 (21/01/2021), it was six AM in the Brazilian time zone, which was the default time zone for all clocks.<br />
Ted, Monika, and Lisa had spent their New Year's Eve with Littletato, Júlia, Carol, Vitória, and Iam.<br />
They were downtown in San Francisco, California, there was a countdown, they counted along with the countdown, waiting for 2021.<br />
Lisa liked to spend her New Year's Eve with her sisters and her brother.<br />
She thought about everything that she did in 2020 and the fact that she reunited with her forgotten sisters.<br />
In January of 2021, the Think Outside The Box or TOTB company had made an announcement.<br />
They said that the Second SpaceLiving Anniversary was going to happen at six PM in the BRT time zone (Brazilian time zone).<br />
And that they would send a notification asking if the LonelyShipper wanted to teleport to the Party SpaceShip to celebrate the second anniversary, unlike last time.<br />
TOTB also had announced on their Discord server on the announcements text channel that the LonelyShip was going to make a course of cooking.<br />
The cooking course was called SpaceLiving Cooking Course 2021.<br />
They said that they are going to use the TPF fridge to get the ingredients.<br />
And also the TPF fridge will teach people how to cook, and it will use the holographic table that exists on the left of it, and you can activate it using the table button on the side of the TPF fridge.<br />
The TPF fridge will help the LonelyShippers to learn how to cook, it can teach the resident how to cook every meal that exists in its food catalog.<br />
The course will start tomorrow, on the eighteenth, and it will last one month, it will teach thirty good recipes of food.<br />
After the thirty-day period ends, the residents that signed up for the course will stop receiving notifications about the daily recipe that they have to cook.<br />
Everyone can do the course even after the one-month period ends.<br />
If someone does the course after that, it will last one month and will have the same recipes that the original had.<br />
And after finishing the course, the LonelyShipper can access the recipes for the food catalog of the TPF fridge.<br />
They can also ask the TPF fridge for help in making the meals.<br />
A LonelyShipper can not access the recipes of the food catalog of the TPF fridge or get help on cooking the meals if it did not do the cooking course.<br />
Every LonelyShipper can open their SpaceLiving App right now and click on the "Cooking Course" tab on the Thought-Powered Fridge TPF section of the left menu.<br />
Your registration will be saved and you will start the course tomorrow, if you wish to stop, you can always cancel the course on the "Cooking Course" tab.<br />
<br />
Lisa already did the things she does every day, her routine, she was at her computer.<br />
She was writing her story called The Oddities of Nature, she was writing chapter number eleven.<br />
Her story talked about nature, the things that nature created, the trees, the wind, lava, water, fire, and rain.<br />
Talking about everything about nature, the story had a personified version of nature, taking care of her animals and living creatures.<br />
Lisa liked to do personifications of inanimate things or concepts.<br />
She saw the announcement that TOTB did on the announcements text channel on the Discord server.<br />
Lisa stopped writing her story and opened the SpaceLiving App, she clicked on the "Cooking Course" tab.<br />
Then she clicked on the "Apply For Course" button, typing in her name, her Discord name and discriminator were written there already.<br />
After that, Lisa clicked on the "Finish Subscription" button, a text appeared on the screen.<br />
"All setup! You'll start your cooking course tomorrow with your TPF fridge! :)," said the message.<br />
Lisa was happy, she wanted to learn how to cook, to be able to cook when she needs, and also when she does not have a TPF fridge.<br />
As if she was in Anny's house or the house of another friend.<br />
Izaque also signed up for the cooking course.<br />
Lisa continued writing chapter eleven of her story, she was listening to a rain sound mix on YouTube to relax while writing.<br />
She wrote for thirty minutes and forty seconds, she stopped writing and registered the time she spent writing on a text file that was her journal.<br />
It was seven and thirty AM, Lisa was a little hungry, she closed Obsidian, which was the program that she used to write her stories.<br />
Then Lisa opened the TPF fridge and grabbed a plate with a hamburger and also grabbed a cup of chocolate milk.<br />
She placed the plate on top of the table, and also the cup, then she opened Super Animes, the website where she watches anime.<br />
After that, Lisa opened her Python script called Comment_Writer.py, it was used to write a comment on the anime website.<br />
Lisa would type the comment on the script screen, after Lisa finished commenting, she would type f and press enter.<br />
The script would ask for the link of the episode of the anime, it then would ask for the episode number.<br />
After that, it would register the comment on a text file with all of Lisa's comments on Super Animes.<br />
Lisa opened the anime called Fairy Tail to watch, she was on the fourth season of it.<br />
It was good to see the wizards and mages do quests, being on the guild of mages called Fairy Tail, and going on adventures.<br />
She liked to see Natsu, Lucy, Gray, Erza, and other characters together, it was a very fun and adventurous anime.<br />
Lisa started watching episode number twenty-seven, it was about the mages going into a challenge on another island.<br />
They were there because they were strong enough to be able to participate in the challenge.<br />
The challenge was created to promote a mage to the S rank, it had Erza, Gildarts, and Mirajane as challenges for the mages to fight.<br />
On the island, there was a place with a lot of caves, and entrances to advance the test.<br />
The caves could have an S-rank mage to fight, a trap, another participant of the test, or nothing.<br />
They did not know what there was in the cave.<br />
Natsu chose Happy as his partner, on episode number twenty-seven, Natsu was fighting Gildarts in one of the caves, he was a very powerful wizard.<br />
Lisa was watching that while eating, drinking, and commenting about the episode using her Python script.<br />
<br />
After some time of watching, Lisa finished watching the episode, she saved her comment and posted it in the comments section of the anime episode.<br />
Then she registered the watched episode using Watch.py, the Python script that Izaque gave to her.<br />
She also registered the watched episode on the MyAnimeList website.<br />
It was eight AM, Lisa stretched herself, she thought about teleporting to Littletato's Mansion to see her.<br />
She got up and walked to her LST, entering inside it and closing its door, clicking on Littletato's Mansion on the screen.<br />
After some seconds, she was inside her LST teleporter in her bedroom in Littletato's house.<br />
Lisa walked to the door of her bedroom, unlocked it, and got out.<br />
She always locks her bedroom door, so people do not enter inside it and mess with her stuff.<br />
Lisa had her phone in her pocket, it was white, she walked to the kitchen, Júlia was there, eating a sandwich with a cup of chocolate milk.<br />
"Hey, Lisa," said Júlia, smiling a little.<br />
"Hey, Júlia, how are you?" asked Lisa.<br />
"I'm good, what about you?" asked Júlia.<br />
"I'm good too, hehe, hey, Júlia, do you work?" asked Lisa.<br />
"Yeah, I do, I work at the Safeway supermarket from ten AM to six PM," replied Júlia.<br />
"Oh, that's interesting, hehe, that's why you could buy this house, right?" asked Lisa.<br />
"Yeah, hehe, I worked for some months to save up some money.<br />
What about you, Lisa?" asked Júlia.<br />
"I work on a website called PicoWorkers, I do small virtual jobs like watching a video on YouTube, upvoting a post on Reddit.<br />
It's not too much, but at least it's something, right?" asked Lisa.<br />
"Yeah, hehe," replied Júlia.<br />
Lisa opened the fridge and grabbed a Doritos packet, she also grabbed a can of Coca-cola.<br />
"I'm gonna go to my bedroom, laters, hehe," said Lisa.<br />
"Oh, okay, laters, Lisa," said Júlia.<br />
Then Lisa walked to her bedroom, turned her computer on, and started eating, she talked a little with some of her friends on Discord.<br />
She was very happy, talking, eating, and drinking, she opened Super Animes to watch an episode of another anime.<br />
Lisa started watching it, it was very fun, she was happy to eat and drink while watching.<br />
<br />
After some hours, it was six PM, and Lisa received a notification on her computer saying that the Party SpaceShip was available to teleport to.<br />
Every LonelyShipper received that notification, they teleported to the Party SpaceShip, Luiza was also there.<br />
Lisa locked the door of her bedroom, entered the LST teleporter, and clicked on the Party SpaceShip on the screen.<br />
Then, after some seconds, Lisa was on the Party SpaceShip.<br />
She said hi to Izaque, Ted, Monika, and Fred, they were there, talking a little, Izaque was drinking a can of Coca-cola.<br />
"Hi, Izaque," said Lisa to Izaque, smiling.<br />
"Hi, Lisa, how are you?" asked Izaque.<br />
"Good, what about you?" asked Lisa.<br />
"Good too, hehe, I'm happy to be here again, to celebrate the anniversary of the network," replied him.<br />
"Me too, hehe," said Lisa, who looked around the spaceship.<br />
Lisa noticed that the Party SpaceShip was bigger than it was on the last anniversary.<br />
"Maybe we had a lot of new LonelyShippers this year, so they needed more space," thought her.<br />
There were also more computers and more TPF fridges.<br />
The computers had a filter that you could activate so only you can see the contents of the screen.<br />
"I'm gonna get something to drink," said Lisa.<br />
"Okay," said Izaque smiling.<br />
Then Lisa walked to one of the TPF fridges, it was pink, she opened it and grabbed a can of Guarana soda.<br />
Izaque looked at Lisa, she was drinking her can of soda, and he thought that she was cute, she walked to Fred to talk with him.<br />
He observed the spaceship with his indistinct eyes, his eyes stopped at Luiza, she was drinking a can of grape soda.<br />
The boy was close to Ted and Monika, they were talking.<br />
Izaque walked to Luiza, looking at her, she had blond hair and dark brown eyes.<br />
"Hey, Luiza, how are you doing?" asked Izaque.<br />
"Oh, I'm doing good, what's your name?" asked Luiza.<br />
"I'm Izaque, the SpaceLiving Volunteer Helper that helped you when you arrived at the network," replied Izaque.<br />
"Oh, it was you, thank you, hehe," said Luiza, smiling.<br />
"No problem, hehe, so, what do you think of the spaceship? The party?" asked Izaque.<br />
"Oh, it's very good, it has good food and good computers, hehe, it's good to meet the other LonelyShippers," replied Luiza, looking at the other people.<br />
"Yeah, hehe, I like to talk to everyone, I'm a Volunteer Helper after all," said Izaque.<br />
<br />
Then Izaque looked at Fred, he was using a computer, playing a game called Tom Clancy's The Division 2.<br />
Fred was playing with Mark, his friend, who was on his right, using another computer to play.<br />
They were very happy while playing, making a mission to rescue a person in another neighborhood.<br />
Fred was drinking a cup of Coca-cola and eating some Doritos.<br />
Mark was sometimes eating a chocolate cake and drinking orange juice.<br />
Izaque looked at that and thought about the LAN gaming centers that he visited when he lived in Brazil.<br />
He had a lot of fun on those, playing GTA San Andreas for the first time, cause his computer was bad at that time.<br />
Izaque continued talking with Luiza, Ted, and Monika, Monika looked at Lisa, she was sitting on the ergonomic chair of a computer.<br />
Lisa was playing some Minecraft on a survival server, she liked to play that game.<br />
She also used GamePlayer.py to register how much time she spent playing that game.<br />
Ted and Monika decided to go to a specific computer on the spaceship.<br />
It was a computer that had a couch in front of it.<br />
The computer had a big screen with an 8K resolution (7680 x 4320) and a 144 Hz refreshing rate.<br />
It looked like it was designed to watch movies.<br />
There were more computers like that close to it, with couches too.<br />
Some TPF fridges were close to the couches, so the people were able to get food easily.<br />
Ted and Monika sat on the couch of one of those computers.<br />
Monika grabbed the wireless keyboard and the wireless mouse along with a base for the mouse that could be lifted on the middle of the couch.<br />
She chose a movie for her and Ted to watch, it was a comedy movie.<br />
Ted and Monika got some food to eat while watching the movie.<br />
After watching the movie for one hour and some minutes, Ted and Monika finished watching it.<br />
It was also nine PM, the TOTB company put to play an audio clip on the big speakers of the Party SpaceShip.<br />
What a guy was saying on the audio also appeared as text on the screen.<br />
He said his name, which was Fred, and said that he was part of the staff of TOTB.<br />
Fred thanked everyone for coming to the Party SpaceShip to celebrate the Second Anniversary of the SpaceLiving Network.<br />
He also said "Protect yourself from the asteroids and live happier!" in an excited and happy tone.<br />
Everyone started teleporting back to their LonelyShips, some stayed there too, playing games, watching, eating, drinking.<br />
Lisa said bye to Ted, Monika, Izaque, and Fred, and teleported back to her LonelyShip.<br />
Izaque also said bye to Ted, Monika, and Fred, he said bye to Lisa and teleported back to his LonelyShip.<br />
Lisa and Izaque will have a long day tomorrow, doing their daily stuff, their daily routine, and also cooking the first recipe of the SpaceLiving Cooking Course 2021.<br />
Izaque and Lisa slept on their LonelyShips, thinking about the anniversary, how it was, and waiting for tomorrow.<br />
<br />
(I loved writing this chapter, I finished writing it on 21/06/2021.<br />
I revised it while listening to a mix of rain sounds, just like Lisa.<br />
Here in Brazil right now is seven PM, it's a little cold and it rains sometimes, just like I said in an older chapter of SpaceLiving.<br />
I loved to write about Lisa's routine again, and about Lisa's conversation with Júlia.<br />
I also liked to write about the Second SpaceLiving Anniversary, the new SpaceLiving cooking course for 2021.<br />
It was good to write about Lisa watching an anime, using the Python scripts that Izaque gave to her.<br />
She teleported to Littletato's Mansion, going to the kitchen to grab some food.<br />
Watching more anime on her bedroom computer in Littletato's Mansion.<br />
It was good to write the "vision changes" on the anniversary part.<br />
Like, Izaque looking at Lisa, and then the story talking about Lisa.<br />
As if Izaque was the character-narrator of the story.<br />
Thanks for reading this chapter, hehe, laters :3.)

		It was a beautiful Sunday in the SpaceLiving universe, everyone was doing their things on their spaceships.<br />
They were living in 2021, in July, Lisa was inside her LonelyShip, drawing a little on the program called Paint Tool SAI.<br />
She and Izaque did the SpaceLiving Cooking Course 2021 for thirty days, they finished it and now knew how to do a lot of recipes that exist on the Food Catalog of the TPF fridge.<br />
They are now cooking every day, making their meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.<br />
They can also ask the TPF for help in cooking recipes that they do not know how to cook, the TPF fridge can give them a tutorial.<br />
Lisa was drawing an anime girl that she thought about, she was drawing the line art of it, the sketch.<br />
She was happy to be able to draw things that appear in her mind, she likes to be creative.<br />
It was eight AM, Lisa already did her morning needs, she ate some warm Canjica, Lisa thought that it was delicious.<br />
(Canjica, pronounced kan-jee-ka, or Mugunzá in the Northeast of the country, is a Brazilian dessert made of white corn, milk, sugar, and spices, it is very popular in Festas Juninas.)<br />
After one hour of drawing, she stopped drawing, registering the time she spent drawing on her text file that was her diary or journal.<br />
Then she opened the Mozilla Firefox browser and opened the Discord app on her computer.<br />
The girl put to play a Future Bass song mix in low volume on YouTube, she switched to the Discord window.<br />
Lisa already said good morning to Izaque, he said that he was editing a Visual Onomatopoeia video.<br />
Which is moving images on a video in synchronization with a song or the instruments on a song.<br />
The girl opened her conversation with Anny, she wanted to play a game with her.<br />
"Hey, how are you Anny?" asked Lisa in a message.<br />
After some minutes, Anny replied, "I'm good, wby?", asked her (wby = what about you).<br />
"I'm good too, I'm happy that you're good, what are you doing?" asked Lisa.<br />
"Oh, I'm just sketching a drawing on PTS, you?" asked Anny (PTS = Paint Tool SAI).<br />
"I was also doing that some minutes ago, right now I'm just listening to some Future Bass," replied Lisa.<br />
After sending that message, Lisa switched to the window of Mozilla Firefox, she did the CTRL+T keyboard shortcut to open a new tab.<br />
Then she opened the Wattpad website, checking her notifications, some people voted on chapters of her stories, they also commented on them.<br />
She was happy to receive votes and comments, she opened some comments on new tabs to reply to them.<br />
After replying to some comments, she closed the tabs, Lisa came back to the Discord window, Anny had sent her a message.<br />
"That's cool, hehe, will you send me it when you finish?" asked Anny.<br />
"Yeah, hehe, I'll send it, send me yours too!<br />
Hey Anny, do you want to play some SAMP with me?" asked Lisa in her message (SAMP = San Andreas MultiPlayer, Multiplayer version of GTA San Andreas game).<br />
"I'll send it to you too, hehe, and yes I want," replied Anny.<br />
Then they both entered on the Discord server that Lisa created for her and Anny to spend some time together.<br />
The name of the server was "Lisanny", which looked like a ship name, Lisa was a little shy about that name when she created the server (ship name = a name for describing the couple name of two people that you want to be together).<br />
(Shipping = A verb used to describe the action of wishing for two people to enter a relationship (whether romantic or occasionally platonic) in books, movies, TV shows, or real life.)<br />
Lisa and Anny joined the voice channel for games, Anny called a bot to play some music on the voice channel.<br />
After that, Lisa closed the Mozilla Firefox tab where the Future Bass song mix was playing.<br />
They started to play some San Andreas MultiPlayer together, they were happy playing, they were playing on an RPG server.<br />
RPG servers on the San Andreas MultiPlayer game are servers where you can live just in real life, working, studying, having a house, a car, friends, eating, drinking, paying bills.<br />
After playing for a while, it was nine AM, Lisa and Anny stopped playing to eat something.<br />
<br />
Izaque had already eaten, he continued editing his Visual Onomatopoeia video, it was a visual onomatopoeia of the song called "FROG PARTY" from the Sharks artist.<br />
The song was a joke song made by Sharks on the first of April of 2020, it is a joke with the Riddim music genre.<br />
At the beginning of the editing, he made a screenshot of a part of the waveform of the song thrown on the Audacity audio editing program.<br />
Izaque made a screenshot of the blue and red waveform, editing it and removing the background.<br />
<br /><img class="image_size border_4px border_color_cyan border_radius_8_cent box_shadow_black" src="https://thestake2.netlify.app/Images/Images/SpaceLiving/Audacity Blue Bass Waveform.png" style="max-width: 50%;" /><br /><br />
After that, he inserted the two pictures of the waveform on the project of the Visual Onomatopoeia on the Sony Vegas video editing program.<br />
He named the two waveform files "Blue Bass" and "Red Bass", the blue one was for emotional basses and synths on the song.<br />
And the red one was for dark, hard, or badass basses and synths.<br />
Izaque made animations and movements on the bass pictures in synchronization with the basses on the song.<br />
He deformed and modified the size of the bass pictures in sync with the digital bass sounds on the song.<br />
The boy had made an Among Us Visual Onomatopoeia using the Among Us characters some days ago.<br />
The song that he expressed visually was the "Among Us Drip Theme Song Original (Among Us Trap Remix / Amogus Meme Music)" made by Leonz.<br />
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzQ6gRAEoy0" target="_blank">"Among Us Drip Theme Song Original (Among Us Trap Remix / Amogus Meme Music) by Leonz"</a><br />
He used the black character for the kick drum, the gray for the hi-hat, and the white one for the snare drum.<br />
Izaque also used the red character to symbolize the acute violin and the brown character to symbolize the grave violin (possibly a cello).<br />
The boy had the idea to use the three drum characters on the Visual Onomatopoeia video of the FROG PARTY song.<br />
He did the visual kicks and snares of the song using those three Among Us characters, the black and white respectively.<br />
Izaque still needed to do the hi-hats, he was focusing more on the basses, making the right movements, syncing the movements with the basses, and synths on the song.<br />
He also inserted a transparent rain animation on the background of the video in the beginning, because the sounds had a rain sound.<br />
Izaque placed the song cover on the parts of the song where a woman said "FROG PARTY".<br />
The boy edited the song cover to add more characters to it, there were frogs on the original song cover.<br />
<br /><img class="image_size border_4px border_color_cyan border_radius_8_cent box_shadow_black" src="https://thestake2.netlify.app/Images/Images/SpaceLiving/Orignal Sharks - FROG PARTY Song Cover.jpg" style="max-width: 50%;" /><br /><br />
He added his Stake2 logo, the full body of his Funkysnipa Cat character, Fluttershy from "My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic", the red and brown Among Uses, and the blue and red bass pictures.<br />
(Stake2 is a name that Izaque uses on the Internet since 2008, in all of the accounts that he created along the time.)<br />
(Funkysnipa Cat is an account of the Google+ social network that Izaque created in 2013.<br />
He created it because it was part of a movement to honor the YouTuber called Funky Black Cat, the name of the movement was called "The Funky Cats".<br />
Other people created accounts with other Funky Cat themes, replacing the "Black" of the name of the YouTuber.<br />
They also edited the original profile picture of Funky Black Cat, adding things that matched the Funky Cat theme that they choose.<br />
Like Funky Ninja Cat, Funky Racer Cat, Funky Duck Cat, Funky Cosmos Cat, Funky Monkey Cat.)<br />
<br /><img class="image_size border_4px border_color_cyan border_radius_8_cent box_shadow_black" src="https://thestake2.netlify.app/Images/Images/SpaceLiving/Funky Black Cat Original Profile Picture.png" style="max-width: 50%;" /><br /><br />
(Izaque discovered a lot of new things on Google+, he discovered My Little Pony, Five Nights at Freddy's, Undertale, started liking Dubstep more.<br />
He also met a lot of great people, he still talks to some of them till today, for example, Lulu, a friend that he knows since 2015, it has been six years already.<br />
Google+ had passed away on the second day of April of 2019, Google decided to close it because it had privacy violations and security problems that Google had hidden some months ago and people discovered them.<br />
Then Google continued working on Google+, but only for companies.)<br />
<br />
The boy also added the pixel art drawing of the LonelyShip spaceship of his story called SpaceLiving to the edited version of the song cover of the Frog Party song.<br />
<br /><img class="image_size border_4px border_color_cyan border_radius_8_cent box_shadow_black" src="https://thestake2.netlify.app/Images/Images/SpaceLiving/Edited Sharks - FROG PARTY Song Cover.jpg" style="max-width: 50%;" /><br /><br />
Izaque placed the original song cover on the parts where the woman said "Frog", and the edited song cover on the parts where the woman said "Party".<br />
By placing the edited song cover with more people on the "Party" parts, Izaque thought that it gave a "Party" feeling to it, with more people.<br />
He also placed an on and off switch animation on the parts that a voice said "Switch", switching the switch on.<br />
The boy still needed to add a Roblox death animation to a part where the oof sound (Roblox death sound) played.<br />
After editing his video more, Izaque saved the Sony Vegas project and closed the video editor.<br />
It was ten AM, Izaque opened the Mozilla Firefox web browser, he opened the Discord web page.<br />
Izaque replied to all of his messages on the direct message part of Discord.<br />
After that, he checked the notifications (pings) of the Discord servers that he was in.<br />
He checked the notifications of the Super Server, the Discord server of the creators of the Super Animes website, an anime website, and the Super Mangás website, a manga website.<br />
Izaque read the notification, it said that the Super Animes website received a DMCA from Disney and other companies.<br />
(A DMCA is when content is removed from a website at the request of the owner of the content or the owner of the copyright of the content.<br />
It is a well-established, accepted, internet standard followed by website owners and internet service providers.)<br />
He was sad to see that, where he would watch anime now? SA was the best website for watching anime for him.<br />
The boy also did a total of eight hundred seventy-six comments on the website.<br />
He met a lot of friends there, and downloaded and watched a lot of anime episodes.<br />
Izaque was using another anime website to download anime in HD recently, it was Animes Vision.<br />
Some weeks ago, he programmed a new Python script called Watch_Class.py, a better version of his old Python script called Watch.py.<br />
He had inserted the Super Animes website as a remote origin to all of the media that were anime on the Media Info database.<br />
After knowing that Super Animes was closed, he edited the Watch_Class.py script to change the definitions of Super Animes to Animes Vision.<br />
And also changed the remote origin on the media details files of each one of the media from Super Animes to Animes Vision.<br />
Then, the boy closed the Discord tab, he opened the Habitica website to register the video that he edited.<br />
He had a habit called "Do some art", which included writing, drawing, editing pictures, making music, or editing a video.<br />
And also registered the "Program/code something" habit.<br />
<br />
After that, Izaque closed the web browser, he opened his Python script called GamePlayer.py to play a game.<br />
He chose the RimWorld game, he was a little addicted to it, he could create a colony and watch it grow, he always had something to do.<br />
Or something to tell the pawns to do, he could see growth and evolution every time, that is why it was addicting.<br />
(RimWorld is an indie top-down construction and management simulation video game by Ottawa-based developer Ludeon Studios.<br />
Originally called Eclipse Colony, it was initially released as a Kickstarter crowdfunding project in early access for Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux in November 2013, and was officially released on October 17, 2018.<br />
The game has a small variety of scenarios to choose from, although the core gameplay is the same.<br />
The player characters (referred to as "pawns" on the game documentation) are stranded on a planet located in the frontiers of known space (a "rim world").<br />
The characters have a randomly generated set of traits that affect how they can contribute to the colony, the decisions they make, and how their existence affects the other characters.<br />
As time goes on, more characters will join the colony.<br />
Characters can be rescued after crash-landing on the player map, they can wander in, or they can be captured after a raid.<br />
Thus said colonists might also contain negative traits such as being pyromaniacs or psychopaths.<br />
The game can end when at least one character has escaped the planet on a spaceship, or when they are all dead.<br />
With the Royalty DLC, the game can also end by hosting the High Stellarch, leader of one of the factions that inhabit the Rim, and leaving the colony with them.)<br />
He loved the game, it helped him see parts of society and humanity that he did not saw before, or did not saw in that perspective.<br />
The fact that we kill animals to get food, used plants as food, and got wood from trees, getting energy from the sun or the wind.<br />
Izaque could give an order to hunt an animal and see the pawns hunting it, bringing it home, slaughtering it, and placing the meat on the fridge that was just a room with a refrigerator that cooled the place.<br />
He was sad because of that, seeing how the pawns work every day for food, water, home, and evolution, making new technologies.<br />
The boy thought that it was bad to do those infinite things every day, things that you do until you are dead.<br />
If Izaque played Factorio, he would see the damage that the factories and bad energy sources can do to Earth and the ozone layer.<br />
He opened RimWorld to play and turned the playing time counter on the GamePlayer.py Python script, by typing one and pressing enter.<br />
Izaque played the game for one hour, after that, it was ten AM, he was a little tired of staying sat for a long time and needed to stretch a little.<br />
<br />
The boy closed the game and stopped the GamePlayer counter, the Python script automatically registered the time that Izaque spent playing the game.<br />
Then Izaque left the Utorrent program open to download some things and seed torrents, which was sending little slices of the file to other people that also wanted to download it.<br />
He got up and walked to another room on the LonelyShip, the door of that room was a type of door called a "Compact Space Door".<br />
The Compact Space Door was a door that could bring someone to a place that was compressed to the width of the door.<br />
Making it possible to the resident of the LonelyShip to open the door and enter inside the place that was after the door, without making the spaceship too large.<br />
Space after the door was a type of space that did not occupy physical space, it was the width of the door.<br />
Izaque had some gym equipment in that room, he had one running machine, a bodybuilder, and an exercise bike.<br />
He also had another compact space door inside the gym room, it led him to a place with natural grass, flowers, plants, and some trees.<br />
His two dogs were there, Nega and Pingo, Nega was a female dog, Pingo was a male dog, Pingo was the son of Nega.<br />
The natural place or garden was really big and wide, Nega and Pingo could run around and do their needs there, the spaceship would clean and destroy their things automatically.<br />
That place had two automatic dog feeders on one wall with dog food and water for Nega and Pingo to eat and drink.<br />
It also had a natural lake with water there, it was not dirty.<br />
Some months after Izaque was teleported to his LonelyShip, the LST teleporter was created on every LonelyShip of the SpaceLiving Network.<br />
He visited his parents for the first time in months and also said that he did not want to live with them, because they made him sad, and he was disappointed with them.<br />
Izaque said that the house had a bad atmosphere and that his father complained too much, it was depressing to even hear the voice of his father.<br />
After saying that, he said that he was going to bring Nega and Pingo to his spaceship, so their parents do not need to take care of them and waste their money with food.<br />
The boy thought about doing that because his parents always complained about not having money.<br />
He also was worried and scared, thinking that his parents were not going to take good care of Nega and Pingo, and would give bad food to them, food that they can not eat, like pasta.<br />
Then the boy brought Nega and Pingo with him on the LST teleporter, he also brought his favorite red cup, his bike, the food and water bowls of Nega and Pingo.<br />
He added the house of his sister, Aline, as a trusted house on the LST teleporter, he did not want to go to the house of his parents when he needed to go to Earth.<br />
Izaque also added the house of his brother Cristiano and his sister-in-law Patrícia as a trusted house, they lived in the same house, it existed in another city, not the city where Izaque was born.<br />
The gym room had a wall screen for each one of the machines, counting the repetitions, time spent on the machine, the calories lost, and the muscle growth.<br />
The boy started exercising on the running machine, he exercised for thirty minutes, he was sweating a little, even if the spaceship adjusted its temperature in sync with Izaque's body temperature.<br />
After exercising for a while on the running machine and the other machines, Izaque stopped, he opened the door to the natural place.<br />
He walked around it, Nega and Pingo saw him, they jumped on his knees, he caressed their fur, Izaque loved the two.<br />
The boy walked to an area chair, sitting on it, there was a cool wind on the place, it was a plain terrain, with some trees, grass, and flowers.<br />
The place had an opening that had protection for air to not escape, it was an opening for the sun to shine and hit the whole place.<br />
Izaque liked to relax and meditate there while drinking some water after brushing his teeth in the morning.<br />
After relaxing a little on the field and caressing Nega and Pingo, it was eleven AM, Izaque said bye to his dogs and left the place.<br />
He walked to the bathroom and placed his hands on a laser square, his hands could cross it.<br />
That laser did not remove his skin or hurt him, it was only for cleaning, it removed bacteria and dirt, he used that after caressing his dogs.<br />
After that, he walked to his computer, sitting on the chair, the movie that he put to download had finished download.<br />
He spent his day on the computer, stopping sometimes to eat, drink water, and exercise.

		It was a good day in the SpaceLiving world, the residents of the spaceships were living in 2021, in August, it was a Friday.<br />
Izaque was in his spaceship, his LonelyShip, it was morning, eight and thirty AM, he was writing a story of him called "The Secret of the Crystals".<br />
The story talked about a fairy called Ana, living on Earth, it was a different version of Earth, it had some mythological creatures.<br />
Creatures like Soul Wasps, Fairies, Kódeks, Stone Ogres, and other creatures.<br />
He loved to write that story, he writes it since 2020, the boy has already written twelve chapters of it.<br />
Izaque wanted to write a lot of chapters, and after that, he was going to make the website of the story, the story, and chapter covers, and post it on Wattpad.<br />
The boy had already made his morning needs, washed his face, brushed his teeth, drank some water, and ate.<br />
Lisa was in her spaceship, she was drawing a little on Paint Tool SAI, she was painting it because she finished the line art.<br />
The girl was very happy with the result of the line art, she finished painting it, it was very beautiful.<br />
After that, Lisa signed the drawing and posted it on the DeviantArt art website, she posted the link to the drawing on her Twitter and Facebook.<br />
Lisa was very happy, she opened Discord and sent the link of the drawing to Anny and Izaque.<br />
"Hey, check out the new drawing I made :3," said Lisa in the message.<br />
Izaque had already finished writing that chapter of "The Secret of the Crystals", he opened Discord to reply to some messages.<br />
He opened his conversation with Lisa, opening the drawing page on his web browser.<br />
The drawing was very beautiful, the anime girl was cute just like Lisa.<br />
Izaque and Anny complimented the drawing, Lisa said thanks to both of them.<br />
After that, Lisa closed Discord, she opened Obsidian to write a little, just like Izaque.<br />
She started to write a chapter of "The Oddities of Nature", the story had fifteen chapters already.<br />
Izaque told his friends that he was going to leave for a while, he closed Discord and turned his computer off.<br />
The boy got up, wore some sneakers and pocketed his phone, walking to the LST teleporter, and entering inside it, he also brought his two-liter water bottle.<br />
Izaque was wearing black shorts and a white t-shirt, the boy had a car that he bought with the money he earned on PicoWorkers, he had the car keys in his pocket.<br />
<br />
He clicked on the picture of the house of his sister Aline in Paranavaí, on Paraná, and closed the door of the LST, after some seconds, he was there.<br />
Izaque was in the house of his sister, she lived in a condominium, he was on the LST teleporter that was in the room of his brother-in-law, he was not there, he was working in another city.<br />
The boy got out of the LST teleporter, he walked to the living room of the house of his sister.<br />
"Hey, Aline," said him to her.<br />
"Hey, little brother," said her, she was sitting on the big brown couch of the living room, fiddling with her phone.<br />
"Is Isis awake?" asked Izaque, sitting beside her.<br />
"No, she is sleeping, Sofia is playing with her friend at her house," replied Aline.<br />
"Oh, okay, I think I'm gonna go downtown, or maybe to Morumbi to spend some time in the house of Jeandre," said Izaque.<br />
"Okay, there's breakfast there if you want, there's Toddy, some French bread, and eggs if you want to make a Crepioca," said Aline.<br />
"Thanks, sis," said him, who hugged her, then he walked to the kitchen, making a Crepioca, which was tapioca flour mixed with broken eggs, and spices and filling.<br />
He placed some salt, pepper, cheese, and oregano on the mixture of flour and eggs, mixing it, he placed a pan to heat on the stove.<br />
After that, he placed the mixture of Crepioca on the pan, waiting for it to heat and gain some consistency.<br />
Then, he turned the Crepioca, waiting for the other side to heat.<br />
Izaque then turned the stove off and grabbed a plate to put the Crepioca, he grabbed a fork and knife and walked to the living room, sitting on the couch.<br />
He had to eat while sitting on the couch because the house of his sister did not have a kitchen table to eat.<br />
The Crepioca he made was delicious, "You won't drink milk?" asked Aline.<br />
"No, it gives me headaches, and I don't like much the taste of it," replied Izaque, who continued to eat.<br />
After some time, he finished eating, he walked back to the kitchen with the plate and washed it, he also washed the fork and knife.<br />
Then, he walked to the living room, "Hey, Aline, I'm gonna go to Morumbi to visit Jeandre," said him.<br />
"Oh, okay, bye, little brother," said Aline, smiling, "Bye, sis," said him, smiling too, it was nine AM.<br />
After that, Izaque walked out of the house by the window, he walked to his car, which was an Astra, opening it by clicking on the alarm button.<br />
Izaque had to leave his car at the house of his sister because he had nowhere to leave it, only at the house of his parents.<br />
He entered his car and turned it on, he had a driver's license, Izaque had a copy of the device to open the gate of the condominium.<br />
The boy drove close to the gate and pressed the button, opening it, after that, he got out of the condominium with his car and closed the gate.<br />
<br />
Izaque began driving around Paranavaí, in Paraná, he was in the Jardim São Jorge neighborhood, he wanted to go to the Jardim Morumbi neighborhood.<br />
He continued driving there, it was a little far, he put to play a rock song on the car's radio to listen to while driving.<br />
Izaque stopped by a supermarket to buy some food, he bought a Doritos packet and a chocolate bar.<br />
The boy continued driving to Morumbi, after some time of driving, he arrived there.<br />
He traveled around the main boulevard of Morumbi, he remembered where his parents lived, they lived on the same block where the parents of Jeandre lived.<br />
Izaque entered on that road, he drove more and stopped close to the gate of the house of Jeandre.<br />
The boy turned his Astra off and got out of the car, walking to the front of the house of Jeandre, he clapped his hands, it was a thing that people did in Brazil when the house did not have a doorbell.<br />
After that, the niece of Jeandre walked out of the house, she said that Jeandre was in his room and that Izaque could enter.<br />
Then Izaque opened the gate and closed it, he walked inside the house and walked to Jeandre's room, saying hi to him.<br />
Jeandre said hi back, Izaque sat on the bed, behind Jeandre, he was playing a little on his Xbox One, listening to some music.<br />
After that, Jeandre closed the game, he opened the games list, when Izaque visited Jeandre, he always had new games downloaded.<br />
Jeandre put his chair back and gave the Xbox controller to Izaque, "What do you want to play?" asked Jeandre.<br />
He told Izaque about new games that he downloaded recently, Izaque looked at the games list, it was nine and forty AM.<br />
Izaque then chose Gears 5, it was a coop game, Jeandre and Izaque could play it together, Jeandre grabbed the other controller.<br />
He and Izaque began to play it together, Izaque was happy to play with him, to see the beautiful game on the big screen, it was running at 60 FPS.<br />
Lisa was in the Mansion of Littletato, she was eating a little in the kitchen, talking with Carol.<br />
Carol said that she was playing a new game recently on her computer, it was called RimWorld.<br />
(RimWorld is an indie top-down construction and management simulation video game by Ottawa-based developer Ludeon Studios.<br />
Originally called Eclipse Colony, it was initially released as a Kickstarter crowdfunding project in early access for Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux in November 2013, and was officially released on October 17, 2018.<br />
The game has a small variety of scenarios to choose from, although the core gameplay is the same.<br />
The player characters (referred to as "pawns" on the game documentation) are stranded on a planet located in the frontiers of known space (a "rim world").<br />
The characters have a randomly generated set of traits that affect how they can contribute to the colony, the decisions they make, and how their existence affects the other characters.<br />
As time goes on, more characters will join the colony.<br />
Characters can be rescued after crash-landing on the player map, they can wander in, or they can be captured after a raid.<br />
Thus said colonists might also contain negative traits such as being pyromaniacs or psychopaths.<br />
The game can end when at least one character has escaped the planet on a spaceship, or when they are all dead.<br />
With the Royalty DLC, the game can also end by hosting the High Stellarch, leader of one of the factions that inhabit the Rim, and leaving the colony with them.)<br />
<br />
"I love that game, I like to create a colony and watch it grow, watch it evolve, it is a little addicting, hehe," said Carol to Lisa, she was also eating something, eating a sandwich.<br />
"Oh, that seems good, I'm gonna buy it to see if I like it, to test it," said Lisa.<br />
"I'm also playing a new game recently, it's Saints Row: The Third, it's like a GTA but funnier and with different things, I like it a lot, hehe," said Lisa.<br />
"I play it too, hehe, it's very fun," said Carol.<br />
Then Lisa continued eating her sandwich that had a hamburger, cheese, ham, and pepper, it was delicious, and it was only nutrients.<br />
Lisa grabbed her phone and opened Discord, she sent a message to Izaque, he was playing a cutscene part of the game.<br />
Izaque grabbed his phone and replied to Lisa, she asked what he was doing.<br />
The boy replied saying that he was visiting an old friend of his on Earth, in Brazil.<br />
Lisa replied saying that it was cool and that she was just eating and talking with Carol.<br />
The two girls finished eating, Lisa said bye to Carol and she said bye back, then Lisa walked to her room, she closed the door and sat on the chair of her computer.<br />
Izaque had taught Lisa how to program/code, she was creating her programs in Python, she was creating a program to register her drawings and how much time she spent on them.<br />
Lisa continued coding the program, it was getting good, she made the program create a list of drawings and the status of them (sketching, line art, painting, ready to post).<br />
She was very happy with her program, the girl registered when she ate using the program that Izaque gave to her.<br />
The girl had her water bottle beside her, she continued programming her app, it was working correctly.<br />
After that, Lisa was ready and happy to test her new program, she made it list the .sai files on a folder of drawings that she had.<br />
Then she opened ConEmu, which was a console emulator, she opened her Python script, which was called Drawing_Manager.py.<br />
Lisa chose one drawing from the list, she chose one called "Anime Scenery With Girl", she began drawing it, the Python script was counting the time she spent drawing.<br />
It was ten AM, Izaque continued playing with Jeandre in his house, he was happy, they switched to another game, it was "The Division 2", Izaque was playing alone.<br />
Jeandre had bought soda, he offered it to Izaque, he accepted and Jeandre filled a cup with soda, giving it to Izaque.<br />
Izaque thanked him, drank a little and left the cup on the floor, the sister of Jeandre had made a pineapple cake, Jeandre offered it to Izaque.<br />
He accepted, Jeandre gave a plate with some cake to Izaque, he ate a little, it was delicious.<br />
Izaque liked to spend some time in the house of his friend, he was happy.<br />
Lisa was happy to program and to draw a little, she was happy to have that ability.<br />
Littletato and Iam were working, Vitória was working too, on the bedroom.<br />
Izaque was happy to get out of his spaceship a little, he liked to spend some time on Earth, to see his sister Aline, and visit his friend Jeandre.<br />
The day will continue, Izaque and Lisa will continue to do things, as they always do.

		It was another day in the SpaceLiving world, the residents were living in January of 2022.<br />
They had a good Christmas, New Year's Eve, and New Year, whether celebrating on the Party SpaceShip, in their LonelyShips, or with their families on Earth.<br />
Izaque also celebrated Christmas, he used a Christmas cap, and Christmas-themed profile pictures on his social networks and wished a Merry Christmas to his friends on them.<br />
He watched some Christmas anime episodes while eating good food, and listened to his Christmas-themed playlist.<br />
The boy had also created a Christmas-themed Windows 10 theme to use, it had dark red colors and a lot of Christmas-themed wallpapers of anime and "My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic".<br />
Izaque spent his December days posting chapters of his story "The Secret of the Crystals" on its website and Wattpad and also posted "The Story of the Bulkan Siblings" on Wattpad.<br />
He also visited his sister Aline who started living in the city of Maringá recently, he visited her with his mother, to see the new condominium she was living in.<br />
The boy also watched a lot of "My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic" episodes, he finished watching it on the 31st of December.<br />
Izaque remade his task recorder Python script, called "Tasks.py", he remade it on the 14th of December, spending two hours on its creation.<br />
He had remade his website about "My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic", re-writing the "thank you" note for MLP FIM, for being part of his life and childhood.<br />
The boy continued to work on PicoWorkers to earn more money, and downloaded the new album of Teminite, a Dubstep artist, called "Raise The Black Flag".<br />
Izaque had gotten a new phone for him on the SpaceLiving Object Catalog, in the "LonelyShip - LS" tab of the SpaceLiving App.<br />
The path of the tabs was "LonelyShip - LS/Manage things/Add/Electronics", he could get new video games, phones, screens, and other electronic things on that menu.<br />
He also prepared his Python scripts for the new year, making "Check First In Year" functions for them.<br />
To register the first watched, played, or done thing on the year, the first anime, cartoon, movie watched, the first game played, or the first task done.<br />
Izaque wrote a text called "This Year I", telling what he did, learned, changed, and things he perceived.<br />
He also made a Python script called "Christmas.py" to execute his Christmas plan, apply the Christmas Windows theme, open social networks, and so on.<br />
The boy watched Christmas anime episodes of "Himouto! Umaru-chan", "Yuru Camp", "Eromanga-sensei", "Sword Art Online", and "K-On!".<br />
He visited his friend and neighbor Jeandre to play a little with him on the 27th of December.<br />
Izaque recorded a video called "About life and physical necessities (Stake2)", he recorded audio in Brazilian Portuguese for the video, talking a little.<br />
The boy created a new Python script on the 28th of December called "Python_Module_Manager.py", to create new Python module folders easier.<br />
On the 31st of December, Izaque made posts and stories on his social networks wishing people a Happy New Year, along with the Happy New Year picture he had made.<br />
Lisa also celebrated Christmas in the Mansion of Littletato, she celebrated along with her sisters and her brother, Ted.<br />
<br />
It was a Friday, day seven of January of 2022, Izaque was in his LonelyShip, it was eight AM.<br />
Izaque was cooking his breakfast after he drank water and got some sun, he used the stove at the left of the TPF fridge to cook, using a pan.<br />
The ingredients like oat, eggs, olive oil, salt, pepper, oregano, and onions were all microorganisms that can turn into any organic thing and still be nutrients.<br />
So the oil will act as oil, but will still be in reality, nutrients, so the person can eat the oil along with the food and will not feel bad or ingest real oil.<br />
He finished doing it, it was scrambled egg with oat and a one-litter bottle of Coca-cola, the boy ate while sitting in his ergonomic chair close to the TPF table.<br />
After that, the boy registered the time that he ate, so he can know when he can drink water.<br />
It is generally ten minutes after you ate for the nutrients to go from the stomach and intestines to the bloodstream and brain.<br />
Izaque started doing his daily things, like checking the daily tasks on Habitica and Microsoft Todo, checking on PicoWorkers to see if his pending money is below eight dollar cents.<br />
The boy had already done some first things of the year, like the first anime, cartoon, or series episode watched, the first game played, the first task that was done.<br />
As the days passed, more and more LonelyShippers learned how to cook through the SpaceLiving Cooking Course.<br />
They became more independent, the majority of them had already bought houses on Earth, to pass time or give parties when they are on Earth.<br />
People also learned how to invest their money, and make it work for them, the SpaceLiving company had made some tutorials on how to work on PicoWorkers, and investment courses.<br />
Lisa was in her LonelyShip, she was listening to a Future Bass mix on YouTube while drawing a little on Paint Tool SAI.<br />
She has been watching some anime art-style videos on YouTube, to improve her skills and her style, she wanted to start drawing Manga.<br />
The girl even asked if Izaque wanted to help her in the story of the Manga, but she still did not start thinking about it.<br />
But she wanted to make a Manga, to draw the characters and scenes just like Izumi Sagiri from Eromanga-sensei.<br />
And Izaque was going to be Izumi Masamune, the writer of the story, with Lisa's help of course.<br />
Izaque had accepted the offer, they were going to start discussing the story and Manga next Friday, day fourteen.<br />
Lisa had made pepperoni pizza, she had made it yesterday night after she ate dinner, that pizza can serve four meals, breakfast, lunch, afternoon breakfast, and dinner.<br />
She ate two slices of the pizza at breakfast, with one glass of Coca-cola, and stored the pizza in the fridge for later, she was happy to be able to make it.<br />
Lisa baked it in the oven at the left of the TPF fridge, with its help, it had some spices, pepper, cheese, and pepperoni.<br />
<br />
Littletato had days off work in January, she was spending some time with her family in Los Angeles, California, United States.<br />
Carol, Ted, Monika, Júlia, Iam, and Vitória were there too, spending some time with Littletato's parents.<br />
They had a big house to accommodate them, the house had seven bedrooms, Vitória and Littletato had made a barbecue there last Sunday, Lisa participated too.<br />
Littletato sometimes did walks in a park in Los Angeles with Júlia and bought some snacks too.<br />
She spent her Christmas along with her family and friends at the house of her parents.<br />
Lisa had finished making the line art of the drawing she was doing, it was ten AM.<br />
The girl closed the program and the "Drawing_Manager.py" Python script, set the drawing status to "Painting", and she stretched herself on the chair.<br />
A new item appeared on the SpaceLiving Object Catalog some days ago.<br />
It was a Stream Deck, which was like a small tablet with buttons, and those buttons were like small screens.<br />
You could customize them to do anything you want on your computer, like changing lights, turning your computer off, or opening a program.<br />
Lisa used it to dim the lights of her spaceship and make them less blue, she grabbed her water bottle from the fridge and took some sips from it.<br />
Izaque used the Stream Deck to also dim the lights of the spaceship, open his Python scripts, and browser, and also do things on the LonelyShip.<br />
Like open doors, turn his PS4 or Xbox One on, get his big computer screen out for watching things.<br />
Lisa stored her water bottle inside the fridge, she closed it and opened it again, grabbing a smaller water bottle.<br />
The girl changed herself and walked to her LST, closing its door and selecting the picture of Littletato's Mansion on its screen.<br />
Now she was at Littletato's Mansion, the girl had recently bought a car with the money she earned with the help of the investment courses.<br />
She walked to the kitchen, the girl had brought her phone, drank more water, and grabbed a stuffed chocolate cookie packet from the kitchen's TPF fridge.<br />
Lisa sat on a chair at the table, opened the packet, and started to eat some cookies, she saw a new message on the WhatsApp group of Littletato's Mansion.<br />
It was a message by Littletato, saying that she, Júlia, and her friends were at Iam's house, doing a party, saying that there was a lot of food there.<br />
And that Ted had converted Iam's fridge to a TPF one, Lisa replied to that message asking if the party was still going.<br />
Littletato replied saying yes, and asked if she was coming, Lisa replied saying yes, she had finished eating the packet of stuffed chocolate cookies.<br />
Lisa grabbed the keys to her car which were in her bedroom, she walked to the garage and entered her car, it was a yellow Porsche 911 GT3 Touring.<br />
The girl was bringing her water bottle, she turned the car on and opened the garage gate, leaving the garage and closing the gate.<br />
She began driving to Iam's house, getting a highway there, Littletato was playing some games on Iam's Xbox One.<br />
<br />
After some time driving, Lisa arrived there, she parked her car in Iam's yard, entering his house.<br />
She said hi to Littletato and her friends, Littletato, Iam, Carol, and Júlia were playing on Iam's Xbox One.<br />
"Hey Lisa, I heard you coming with your car from far away, its sound is so cool, hehe," said Iam, smiling.<br />
"Isn't it? Hehe, want to give it a ride later?" asked Lisa.<br />
"Sure," replied Iam, smiling, "There's cake in the kitchen if you want, I made it, I mean, the TPF made, hehe," said Iam.<br />
"Okay, thanks," said Lisa, who walked to the kitchen, Ted, Monika, and Vitória were there, sitting at the table, talking.<br />
Vitória was asking Ted and Monika about how living in the SpaceLiving Network was, they explained that to her.<br />
She told them how Earth Izaque, a man from another universe, created them, the SpaceLiving Network, and "The Life of Littletato" story.<br />
They were shocked, Lisa too as she heard that, "Hey... Guys..." said Lisa, looking at the trio with shocked eyes.<br />
"Oh, hey, Lisa, sorry for telling a shocking story just after you arrived, hehe," said Vitória, Ted and Monika said hi too.<br />
"No, it's okay, so... Earth Izaque created us, right? The story of my onee-chan (sister) and the SpaceLiving story...<br />
It is not the Izaque who lives inside a spaceship in the SpaceLiving Network right?" asked Lisa.<br />
"No, it isn't the SpaceLiving Izaque that Ted and Monika told me about, it was Earth Izaque writing that SpaceLiving Izaque created the story," replied Vitória.<br />
Then Lisa got closer to the table, putting her elbows on the table, "What about the others? Do they know about that?" asked Lisa in a low voice.<br />
"Yes, they already talked with Earth Izaque through a video call, ask Littletato if you want to talk with him," replied Vitória.<br />
"Oh, okay, I'll ask her," said Lisa, who looked at Ted and Monika, they were shocked too.<br />
"Well, that's too much for me to digest, right hon?" asked Ted to Monika.<br />
"Yeah, it's weird, I'm shocked, I want to talk with Izaque too, to test him, and see if he knows something that no one here knows about me," replied Monika.<br />
"I'll do that too, hon, it seems like a great idea," replied Ted.<br />
"Want cake?" asked Vitória, smiling innocently while looking at Lisa, after giving her an existential crisis.<br />
"Yes, I want a piece of cake with some existential crisis," said Lisa, who laughed a little, the trio laughed too.<br />
She grabbed an empty plate and a spoon from Iam's TPF, then cut a cake slice for her.<br />
There was Coca-cola too, Lisa filled a cup with it, she sat at the table to eat and drink, and also to talk with her sister-in-law, her brother, and Vitória.<br />
They talked more about Earth Izaque, SpaceLiving Izaque, how it is to live on the SpaceLiving Network, plans for life and the new year, and philosophical things.<br />
Vitória said that she was doing an investment course, to learn how to invest her money, Lisa said that she did one too, that is how she bought her Porsche.<br />
After eating a little, playing, talking, listening to music, and watching some things on Netflix, the group of friends walked to their bedrooms to sleep.<br />
Iam's house had seven bedrooms, Littletato and Júlia slept together, Ted and Monika too, Vitória, Iam, Carol, and Lisa slept alone in their bedrooms.<br />
The group of friends slept on a cold night with blankets, on the night of a Friday in January of 2022.<br />
They wanted to wake up tomorrow, Saturday, and party more, spend more time together, maybe do some barbecue, travel around, go to a racing track with their cars.
