		<h4 id="chapter_1_text" class="text_size unselectable  text_dark_green_water" style="text-align: left;">
		I was a boy that always loved to watch videos of survivalism, bushcraft, things about nature, and survival.<br />
Lived with my parents and used to go to school, I lived a normal life, I was fifteen at the time.<br />
I loved nature, trees, and plants, and I liked to go to beaches and forests when traveling with my parents.<br />
It was always so relaxing to go to the beaches and forests, feel the wind, nature, breathe the pure air.<br />
I wanted to try making nature crafts sometimes, make an ax, a boat, hunt animals, catch fish, cook stuff.<br />
It would be so fun to do that, just thinking about it makes me excited, that is my dream, to survive in nature.<br />
My name is Ryan, and I have seventeen right now, on the day that I am telling you this story.<br />
<br />
One day, my parents and I went on a ship trip, everything was going well, it was a 20-night trip.<br />
People were distracted by the vibe and the loud music, drinking and talking.<br />
The ship's commander was drunk and distracted too, the ship was going towards some rocks, neither the people nor the commander noticed it, but I did.<br />
I was very scared, I tried to warn someone, shouting: "Look ahead! caution!"<br />
I pulled on my dad's shirt but he did not hear me, he just told me to go watch some game videos on his phone.<br />
Then another person heard me and turned the ship sharply, moving the steering wheel, the ship grazed the rock.<br />
And then it fell on its side, causing passengers to fall on the water, creating big bumps in the water, some managed to hold on.<br />
One of these was my father, he ran to the other side of the ship with me, he held on to keep from falling, holding my hand with his other hand next.<br />
My mother was on the other side of the ship.<br />
Suddenly my hand slipped and he could not hold it anymore, he unintentionally released it and tried to hold it back.<br />
I remember seeing him shouting something, but the loud noise of the ship and the people shouting did not let me hear him, I saw his mouth move but I did not hear anything.<br />
So I fell off the ship, looking at my father and wishing he could save me.<br />
I was very scared at that time, everything seemed to be going in slow motion before my eyes, the sight of the ship turning and people falling.<br />
Then I hit my back in the water and tried to swim higher, I looked at my father and saw him screaming in despair and looking at me.<br />
I thought that everything was lost and that I was going to die right there.<br />
My body started to sink in the water and I started to drown myself, my lungs filled with water.<br />
I think a lot of people died there, I hope my parents are alive, I would hate to lose them.<br />
<br />
After a while, I wake up on a desert island, there is no one around me, it is morning, I open my eyes, looking at the blue sky.<br />
I hear birds chirping in the distance and I see them flying, I hear the sound of trees swaying in the light wind.<br />
The wonderful and relaxing sound of the water hitting the island's shore gets to my ears, the ocean moving and breathing calmly.<br />
Feeling at peace, I close my eyes to relax, to hear the beautiful and relaxing sounds of nature, it is so good to be here.<br />
I remember what happened before when the ship toppled over and many people drowned.<br />
Lying on the beach, I look at the blue sky, with few clouds, the cool breeze hitting me, I feel sad without my parents.<br />
My body feels hungry, my belly growls, I leave my hand on top of it and think of barbecue meat.<br />
I know I have to get up, or else I would die in here.<br />
Getting up, I clean my clothes and my face, which were soiled with sand.<br />
<br />
While walking around the island looking for people, I only find birds, rocks, sand, trees, and some sugarcane and bamboo.<br />
I cry for help but I can not hear anything except the echo of my voice at the island.<br />
I remember the days when I watched videos of survivalism, survival, and bushcraft.<br />
Thinking about that topic, I try to remember the name of a specific YouTube channel about it.<br />
It was called "Primitive Technology", I learned many things about nature, survival, and bushcraft with it.<br />
There were videos of bushcraft and nature craft, they were so relaxing, no talking or tutorials, only actions, nature.<br />
Also, there were agriculture videos, videos of primitive knives, axes, spears, bows, houses, huts, a lot of things.<br />
I already learned how to make ropes out of leaf fibers, plants, and other things, but I never tried doing it.<br />
I think of trying to make a rope out of leaf fiber, remembering the things I learned from the videos.<br />
Then I walk a little more and go inside the forest, I find a small stone that is shaped loosely like a knife.<br />
I find a big stone and soak it with water from a small river that is nearby.<br />
So I sit on the ground with the stone that looks like a knife and I start carving it until it looks like a sharp knife.<br />
After that, I get up and look for a thick tree, I start cutting it in half with the knife, hitting the knife with a thick tree branch.<br />
Then I cut it in half to make an ax handle, I take the handle to the same place I was and sit there.<br />
I start to make a hole in the handle so I can put a sharp stone inside it.<br />
After making the hole, I look for a rectangular stone and find one, taking it to the place where the ax handle was.<br />
I use the same big, wet stone as before to polish the rectangular stone.<br />
After doing this, I place the rectangular stone in the handle hole and hit it with a tree branch, to adjust it and fasten it on the handle.<br />
<br />
After making the ax, I pick it up and walk to the coast of the island where there is sand.<br />
I leave the ax on the ground and start bringing stones from the forest to the sand.<br />
Writing the word "Help" in Brazilian Portuguese on the sand using the stones, then I take my ax back.<br />
After that, I think of my parents, I wonder if they are looking for me, I feel sad to be without them.<br />
I miss them so much, I wanted to be with them right now, even if I am happy here, surviving, making nature craft.<br />
Lying on the sand, I leave my ax beside me and watch the waves of the water move.<br />
I see an ocean so vast, I see other islands in the distance.<br />
I want to visit those islands one day, I think it would be cool to do that.<br />
Maybe there are other people there, surviving like me, waiting for someone to come by, waiting for help.<br />
"What do these islands hold for me? What will I discover there? Maybe just animals and nature... Maybe more.<br />
Maybe something more special, rare, and exciting, I don't know, but I need to go and take a look someday.<br />
I have the curiosity to go there and look, because I like to learn new things and to discover secrets, to explore," I think to myself.

		Leaving my ax on the beach, I pick up my sharp stone knife.<br />
I think about making a basket to be able to store things.<br />
Looking for soybean seedlings to make a rope, I cut some of them with my knife.<br />
Picking them up and walking over to where my ax was, I leave them on the ground.<br />
I go to the forest again and pick up some palm leaves to use as a weaving material.<br />
Then I go back to the place where my ax is and leave the leaves aside.<br />
I split the soy cane in half to get an even more flexible material.<br />
I start tying the leaves in a spiral roll to serve as the bottom of the basket.<br />
After finishing the bottom of the basket, I start using leaves and strands of soy cane to make the top part of the basket, spiraling upwards.<br />
Then I finish making the basket and leave it close to my ax, it is very tall, I think I can store a lot of things inside it.<br />
I walk to the forest looking for a good place to stay.<br />
Near the part of the island where there is sand, I find some trees that were born in a very convenient way.<br />
They are a little downward, and their large leaves that look like palm leaves are forming some kind of shell.<br />
A shell with two large leaves, where I can lie down, protect myself from rain or heat, and also sleep.<br />
<br />
I think it is a good place to stay, I go to the beach and hold my ax with my hands, I keep my stone knife in my pocket.<br />
Then I see that there are a little dirt and sand on the ground of the shell of leaves.<br />
After that, I take a large palm leaf and use it as a carpet for the ground, so I do not get dirty with the dirt and sand.<br />
Then I leave my ax and knife there, close to the carpet of the shell of leaves.<br />
I go over to where I left the basket and pick it up, bringing it to the shell of leaves, leaving it beside me.<br />
Sitting on the shell, I feel the cool breeze and relax a little, looking at my ax, knife, and basket.<br />
Then I feel my belly growl again, but this time it is louder.<br />
I get up and look for fruit trees, I find an apple tree and a banana one.<br />
After that, I collect some of the fruits, eating two bananas, I keep the rest of the bananas and apples that I collected inside the basket, close to the shell of leaves.<br />
I look inside the basket, it has five bananas and three apples.<br />
<br />
After eating another banana, I feel satisfied.<br />
I think I need to learn how to make a fire, it is getting cold in here.<br />
Then I pick up my stone knife and look for some coniferous trees, after finding them, I cut some.<br />
After that, I bring some kindling to a place near the shell of leaves.<br />
I place them on the ground, putting one on top of the other.<br />
With two sticks in hand, I take my knife and cut three holes in one stick.<br />
I pick up some dry leaves on the ground to use as a wick, grinding them, then I bring them next to the place where the sticks were.<br />
After that, I place the stick that has holes on top of the milled leaves and I pick up the other stick without holes.<br />
I sit on the ground and place it in one of the holes in the other stick, turning it against the other until smoke comes out of the milled leaves.<br />
After the smoke appears, I remove the two sticks from the leaves and pick them up with my hands, blowing gently to ignite the fire.<br />
I manage to make it burn, I take the milled leaves and place them on top of the kindling arranged in the shape of a campfire.<br />
Then I keep adding small sticks over the fire while I blow it to make it bigger.<br />
<br />
After that, I walk to a part of the island where there is a water stream coming from a brook.<br />
They say that it is there where the best water is obtained, the running water, I start to get some mud that was close to the water.<br />
Then I make a ball of mud, bringing it to the place where I made the fire, it was a little weak, I added more sticks and branches to it.<br />
After doing that, I find a big stone and place it next to the ball of mud.<br />
I start shaping the ball of mud to make a mud cup, leaving it on top of the big stone, close to the fire for it to dry.<br />
Then, I wait for a while, the mud cup gets dry, I take another big stone and leave it close to the fire, putting some ashes of the fire on top of it to better handle the mud.<br />
<br />
After the fire goes out, I place the ashes of it close to the big stone with ashes on top of it.<br />
Then I start another fire using the two sticks and milled leaves, placing sticks around the mud cup.<br />
Waiting for a while, I look inside the bunch of sticks, the mud cup is glowing hot and red, turning to ceramic.<br />
I grab some sticks and remove the mud cup from the inside of the sticks.<br />
Tapping the mud cup with one stick, I notice that it is very firm.<br />
I walk to the brook in the forest, filling the mud cup with water, then I go back to the place where the fire was.<br />
Then I light the fire again, I place the mud cup on top of the sticks, waiting for the water to boil.<br />
After that, I remove the mud cup from the fire.<br />
I wait for a while for the water to get a little chill, then I grab the cup with my hands.<br />
I take a few sips of the water, it is really good and refreshing.<br />
<br />
The fire is still burning, I still have that ball of mud that I made, I use some of it to make a lid for the cup.<br />
After I finish making the lid, I place it close to the fire, covering the lid with some branches.<br />
Then I wait for a little, the lid becomes dry, I grab it and close the cup of water with it, bringing it to the shell of leaves, sitting on the ground, and looking at the sea.<br />
Leaving the cup of water beside me, at my right, I leave my ax on my left, close to the stone knife.<br />
The cup of water is close to the basket that I built, it is late afternoon, almost dark, I grab a banana from the basket, eating it.<br />
Then I bury the peel, I notice that the fire is almost out, the smoke is still coming out.<br />
I drink the whole cup of water that I filled, filling it again with water, leaving it close to the fire for the water to boil.<br />
After that, I start the fire again using the two sticks, waiting for the water to boil.<br />
The water boils, I wait for it to get chill, after that, I grab the cup with my hands, drinking some of the water, and closing it with the lid.<br />
Then I walk to the shell of leaves, leaving the cup close to the basket.<br />
I grab a large palm leaf that was close and cover myself with it, using it as a blanket.<br />
After that, I sleep calmly, dreaming about good things, feeling nature.<br />
The chill breeze, hearing some birds in the distance, hearing the palm leaves swaying in the wind, the ocean moving.<br />
It is really good to sleep here on this island, it makes me calm and relaxed, the weather is good, not too hot, not too cold.<br />
This is what I wanted, to sleep in nature, to sleep close to trees, sand, dirt, feeling the leaves move, hearing and feeling nature, the birds, and other animals.

		I wake up in the middle of the morning, looking at the sun on the horizon, I feel calm and relaxed.<br />
Looking at my left, I see my ax and my knife, all made of stone, I smile.<br />
I open the basket and eat two bananas, I think I need to make a farm to plant vegetables.<br />
Grabbing my ax, I get up and walk to the forest, thinking of making a house.<br />
Walking to the shell of leaves, I store my knife in my pocket.<br />
I cut seven trees and bring the logs to a part at the right of the shell of leaves, in the dirt part of the island.<br />
I dig four holes and place one log in each one, the holes make a square.<br />
Then I place one taller log in the middle of the front side of the house, and one on the backside.<br />
I get some logs and make holes in them, to place them on the left and right sides of the house, making the base of the wall and joining the vertical beams together.<br />
Then I use soy cane fiber to fix them together.<br />
<br />
I make a triangle format using two logs and I join them together with the fiber.<br />
Repeating this process two more times, I make three roof bases, then I place a log between the two foundation logs, with a hole, to fix them together.<br />
I grab the three roof bases and place them at the top of the foundation of the house, making the base of the roof.<br />
I make a tile frame out of a thin stick and start making some tiles to use as the roof of the house.<br />
While making the tiles, I make a nib on each one of them for the roof bases to hold.<br />
I place the tiles on the ground and leave them to dry.<br />
Then I make a furnace using mud and fire, to heat the tiles and make them harder.<br />
After finishing the furnace, I fire it up and place the tiles inside it, I use broken tiles to cover the kiln, then I wait for a while.<br />
Then, after waiting, I remove the broken tiles from the top of the furnace using a stick and grab them with my hand.<br />
I walk to the house and start placing the tiles on the roof, with the several logs that I placed in the roof frame helping hold the tiles.<br />
After a while of working on making the tiles and placing them, I noticed that there was a hole in the roof, the center hole in the middle of the house, I needed some curved tiles to close that hole.<br />
I started making some curved cap tiles to put there, using a log to curve them.<br />
Then I start the fire on the furnace again and heat the tiles, making them harder.<br />
I place the first curved tile carefully on top of the roof, I get inside the house and continue placing the tiles.<br />
<br />
Then I start grabbing some large stones to use as a wall for the house.<br />
After placing them, I start digging an underground heating system and covering it with flat stones.<br />
There is a hole on the backside of the house, and one on the front side.<br />
I start sealing the flat stones with mud and making a fire at the front of the house, in the front hole, the smoke comes out of the hole in the backside of the house.<br />
Then I make a chimney in the back of the house to improve airflow.<br />
I put more mud at the top of the heating system and place more wood in the underground fire.<br />
Walking to my shell of leaves, I pick up my cup of water and open it, drinking a little.<br />
I walk to the house I am making and pick up some water from the cup with my fingers, pouring it on top of the heating system, the water gets really hot.<br />
The heated platform is warm and makes a good bed, I leave the cup of water closed and place it on my left side, I lay on the bed to test the warmth of it.<br />
<br />
I get up and drink a little more of my cup of water, closing it again.<br />
Then I start getting some mud and start building the wall.<br />
I keep adding more mud and arranging it with my hands, adding more stones and more mud, repeating this process a lot of times.<br />
Stopping this process, I make three tiles and add them to the top of the chimney on the back of the house, to protect it from rain.<br />
Then I continue making the walls, adding mud, stone, then mud again.<br />
I add a log on the upper side of the house, horizontally, to make the upper part of the door.<br />
And then I continue to make the walls.<br />
After some hours, I finish making the walls and make a timber door using logs and soy fiber.<br />
I make the floor part of the door with mud.<br />
Then the hut or house is completed, it has a warm bed inside, a door, and an underground heating system.<br />
Even after the fire is out, the bed stays completely warm.<br />
I walk to the forest and pick up some tree resin, then I grab a stick and place the resin in it, bringing the stick in the fire to make a torch.<br />
And then I make a small tile and place some resin in it, I light it and leave it on the side of the bed to light the house.<br />
I go to the shell of leaves and pick up my basket, bringing it to the inside of the house.<br />
Then I get my ax which was outside, close to the furnace I built, I leave the ax on the right of the basket, along with the stone knife and water cup.<br />
<br />
I go out and see that it is afternoon.<br />
Then I get inside the house and drink all of my cup of water, I get up and walk to the brook that has flowing water and fill the cup with water.<br />
I walk to the furnace I made and close the cup, I grab some mud and put them on top of the furnace, to make a support for the cup.<br />
Making fire in the furnace, I wait for the support to dry, then I place my closed cup of water on top of the furnace, waiting for the water to boil and be safe to drink.<br />
The water boils, I remove the cup carefully with sticks, trying to not get burnt.<br />
Then I place the cup of water on the left side of the bed, inside the house, I close the door and then I wait for the water to get cool.<br />
My stomach growls, I open the basket of fruits and eat two bananas, then I lay on the bed to rest a little.<br />
I feel proud of myself, those videos taught me a lot about nature and the arts of the forest, I feel proud of the house, basket, ax, and knife.<br />
I wonder if I will find any animals or people on this island or other islands.<br />
Lying on the bed with the door closed, the underground fire is on, the bed is warm, I start sleeping again, feeling proud of myself.

		I wake up and stand up, it is morning, drink a little of the water that is on the cup, closing it again.<br />
My belly growls, I open the basket and eat two bananas out of it, feeling better.<br />
I think that my basket needs a lid, so I get my knife, open the door of the house, walk to some soy cane saplings and cut some of them.<br />
Then I start making a lid for the basket using the soy cane fibers.<br />
I finish it, then go inside the house and place it on top of the basket.<br />
Grabbing my ax, I get outside the house and look at the sun, it is high in the sky.<br />
I walk to the shell of leaves and sit on it, looking at the ocean and feeling a good chill.<br />
Looking at the clouds, I remember a game I played when I was at my house, it was called Don't Starve.<br />
It was about surviving in a weird land created by a man called Maxwell.<br />
I loved to play that game, especially as Wilson, I think he is the main character.<br />
And surviving like this, making these nature things, makes me think about that game.<br />
Even if I am not in a land like that one of Don't Starve, I think the things I saw in that game helped me survive a little here too.<br />
I get happy, but a little sad that I can not play that game anymore, because I do not have a computer.<br />
I get up, walk to the house and drink a little of the cup of water, then eat one banana.<br />
Then I check if my knife is in my pocket, it is, and I am holding my trusty ax.<br />
Entering the house, I leave my ax and my knife on the right side of the basket.<br />
Then I take off my shorts, my underwear and walk to the ocean.<br />
<br />
Starting to swim, I feel the chill water touching my body, relaxing and swimming a little, I dive into the water and swim more and more.<br />
Some heavy waves hit me, pushing me in the direction of the island.<br />
I swim more and see some fishes inside the water, and some corals, the water is crystal clear, I can see right through it.<br />
While feeling the water touch my body, cooling me, I feel happy and good.<br />
Then I dive a little deeper and get back to the surface to catch some air, then I dive again.<br />
After a while, I climb to the surface and look at the island, I can see it well now because I am far away, I can see all the trees, then I start swimming back there.<br />
I get there and walk on the sand, feeling my body wet and dripping with water.<br />
Walking to my house, I put on my underwear and my shorts again.<br />
I take my ax and start cutting down some trees.<br />
Then I take a branch that I cut off and I make a tip on it.<br />
I cut a sprout to make a spear and make a hole in it.<br />
I tie the sprout hole to prevent the wood from breaking.<br />
<br />
Then I walk to a place near the house with the branch, the sprout with a hole, and some dry leaves dented to use as fuel for the fire.<br />
I leave both on the ground and start to make a fire with a sprout with a hole and another sprout, spinning against each other.<br />
After the smoke appears, I start to blow it gently, making more smoke appear.<br />
After a while of blowing, I notice that a fire starts to appear on the dry leaves, I put them in a hole and leave a branch with dry leaves on top of it, continuing to blow.<br />
Then I take the dry leaves out of there after the branch starts to catch fire.<br />
I take a large stone and leave it next to the fire, then I take the sprout that will be used to make a spear and leave it inside the fire.<br />
After that, I take the sprout from the fire and rub it on the stone to sharpen it.<br />
Then I take a piece of wood and rub the spear to polish it.<br />
I put the spear on the end of the branch to make a spear thrower.<br />
Walking over to the house, I leave the spear and the thrower standing on the left side of the basket.<br />
<br />
I think I got a weapon and I am happy.<br />
Coming out of the house, I look up at the sky and see that it is afternoon.<br />
I go to the house and drink the whole cup of water.<br />
Taking it, I walk to a stream with running water and get some water.<br />
After that, I light the fire in the furnace outside the house and leave the cup full of water covered on top of it.<br />
I wait for it to boil and then I remove the cup with two sticks.<br />
After a while, the cup has cooled down, I pick it up and take it to the house, leaving it beside the bed.<br />
I take my ax and leave it beside the basket.<br />
Lying down on the bed to get some sleep, I take a deep breath.<br />
I think of Don't Starve again, and I see that I do not need light to spend the night like at the game because there is no monster of the night to catch me.<br />
I set myself up and sleep, having some dreams related to the island, deserts, the ocean, and a boy living on an island that I wanted to meet in the dream.<br />
Some time has passed, I am deeper into the dream, and I can see that the boy is Nagai Kei from an anime that I watched, the Ajin anime.<br />
An Ajin is a being that can come back from the dead and regenerate, that is why the governments on the anime want so much to capture them, to discover their secret to reviving.<br />
He is alone on that island because he was running from the Japanese government, they want to capture him to do scientific experiments.<br />
So I appeared there on his island with a boat, and said hi to him, surprisingly, he understood what I was saying.<br />
I told him that I was not from the Japanese government and that I did not want to capture him.<br />
And I said that I had shipwrecked on an island near his, and I was surviving there, until now, and I wanted to explore some islands with my boat.<br />
He understood, and got calmer, he asked if I needed help with anything, I said no, and thanked him.<br />
While dreaming, I asked myself if he was really on some island close to mine, I wanted to meet him, he looks to be cool and gentle.

		I get up, it is morning, I drink some water and look at the sun, after that, I eat one banana.<br />
Then I grab my spear, I go to the ocean and try to catch a fish, looking at the fish there.<br />
My father taught me how to catch fish one time, I hope I can remember how to make it.<br />
After trying for a while, waiting for the water and the fish to get calm, I manage to catch one.<br />
Then, I grab it, walking to the furnace close to the forest, I leave it on a small stone there.<br />
The fish looks to be good, I grab three sticks and place two on the sides of the furnace.<br />
After that, I put the fish on a spit, placing the spit on top of the two other sticks.<br />
I go to the forest, grabbing my two small sticks, bringing them to the furnace, I leave them close to it.<br />
Then I grab my ax and cut some trees, I grab the logs and go back to the furnace.<br />
After doing that, I start to make some fire on the furnace using the two sticks and some dry leaves.<br />
I manage to make some fire, the fish starts to cook.<br />
My mother taught me how to find plants and good spices in nature.<br />
She had a plantation of oregano, basil, bay leaf, chives, nutmeg, and paprika.<br />
And taught me how to identify those spices or plants in nature.<br />
I start looking for some plants in the forest, grabbing some and smelling them.<br />
After looking for a while, I found oregano, paprika, and chives.<br />
I go back to the furnace, leaving the plants that I got on top of a stone.<br />
Then I go back to the forest, to the running water, I grab some mud and go back to the furnace.<br />
Leaving the mud on top of a stone, I make another fire close to the furnace.<br />
I make a bowl to place the fish and the spices, then I place it on top of the fire to dry.<br />
<br />
After waiting for a while, the bowl was dry, I place the spices on it and grind them with a stick, it is afternoon.<br />
The fish was ready to be turned, I turn it and wait for more time, leaving the spice bowl close to the furnace.<br />
I walk to the banana tree and grab some bananas, walking to the hut in the forest and placing them in the basket.<br />
Then I go to the beach again, I grab my spear and bring it back to my hut.<br />
After that, I go to take a walk on the island, I find a coconut tree, I climb it to grab one.<br />
Grabbing the coconut, I walk to the hut and grab my stone knife, I sit on the floor of the hut, trying to crack the coconut open.<br />
I manage to make some cracks in it, then I leave it on the floor, I go back to that running water in the forest, grabbing some mud.<br />
Then I go back to the beach, the other fire is still on, I make another mud cup for myself and let it dry close to the fire.<br />
After that, I remove the fish from the spit cause it was already cooked.<br />
I grab a big stone and leave the fish on top of it, then I remove its scales, thorns, and bones, I season the fish with the spices in the bowl.<br />
Seasoning the fish, I grab the dry cup and walk back to the hut, I crack the coconut more and place the cup below it, collecting its water.<br />
Then I go back to the beach, I grab the big stone with the fish.<br />
Going back to the hut, I sit on the floor and start to eat the fish and drink the coconut water.<br />
"Ah, it's very good to eat a well-seasoned fish with some coconut water, so refreshing and good," I think to myself.<br />
I think of that boy from my dream of yesterday, I look forward, seeing the waves of the ocean.<br />
Then I look to my left, the front of the hut is open to the ocean, I see a big island at my left.<br />
I think of making a raft to visit other islands and bring some food in the raft, I think I will need something to protect me from rain it if rains while I am navigating.<br />
After that, I grab my ax and get up, I start to cut some spruce trees in the forest, they are not heavy as oak wood, so they can float in water.<br />
I get eight logs and measure them to see if they have the correct length, then I remove the knots and bark off them.<br />
Then I get two more logs, they have nine feet (2.7 m), the other eight have eight feet (2.4 m).<br />
After that, I start bringing the logs to the water to build it easily, so I do not have to bring the completed raft across dry land.<br />
<br />
I place two floater logs parallel to each other, then I put the two nine feet logs on the sides of those two logs, connecting them, leaving me with a square.<br />
Then I tie my soy cane fiber rope around a connecting log using a clove hitch knot, it is late afternoon.<br />
I tie the fiber rope to the floating log, then I repeat the same process on the bottom part of the connecting log.<br />
After that, I add one more log, wrapping the rope around the main log, to each side of the connecting log.<br />
I keep repeating this process until I use all of the six remaining logs, tying them together and making the floor of the raft.<br />
Then I finish with a clove hitch knot on the other side of the connecting log.<br />
After that, the raft is finished, I push it a little to see if it floats, it does, then I grab my stone knife and a thick branch from a tree in the forest.<br />
I go back to the raft and start hitting the stone knife on a corner of the raft, making a hole.<br />
Making the hole, I place a small stick in it, then I use my fiber rope to make a knot on that stick.<br />
I cut a tree and cut it in half, then I bury the half log on the sand, making a pole.<br />
After that, I tie the fiber rope that was in the stick in the log, for holding the raft and not letting it go away.<br />
Then I cut another tree, I cut it in half, making it half-length, then I split it, making a good oar.<br />
I grab the other half of the log and start carving with my stone knife to make the part of the oar that looked like a spoon or a wooden spoon.<br />
Leaving the oar on top of the raft, I get up and grab my stone knife, then I go back to the hut, sitting on its ground.<br />
It is almost night, I eat two bananas and drink a little of my cup of water.<br />
Then I wait for a while, waiting for the bananas to be digested.<br />
After that, I go back to the forest with my ax, I cut two trees and cut the logs in half.<br />
Cutting them in half, I place three logs on top of the raft, making three walls for it, tying them with my soy cane rope.<br />
I go back to the hut, sitting on its ground, I look at the moon, it is on the horizon, so big, illuminating the whole ocean.<br />
I get up and light the fire of the hut, warming the bed, I close the door and lay, closing my eyes.<br />
Proud of myself for making a raft, I think of where I want to go with it, and what I want to bring, food, water, my tools, and maybe something else.<br />
After that, I sleep calmly, hearing the ocean waves, hearing some birds on trees.<br />
I survived for five days already.

		I wake up, it is morning, I open the door and look at the raft on the ocean, moving a little, it has been four days since I shipwrecked on this island.<br />
After that, I get up and open the basket of fruits, eating one banana, I drink some sips of my cup of water, getting out of the hut with it and filling it on the running water.<br />
Then I walk to the beach, igniting the fire of the furnace and placing the lid on the cup, placing the cup on top of the furnace for the water to boil.<br />
I grab some mud close to the running water in the forest, then I go back to the beach, leaving the mud on top of a stone.<br />
Leaving the mud there, I grab some of it and start making a tall jar of mud, to fill it with water.<br />
Making the jar, I make a lid for it too, I hear the water in the cup boiling, then I remove the cup with two sticks.<br />
I leave the jar on top of the furnace, waiting for it to dry.<br />
After waiting for some minutes, it is dry, I grab it and leave the lid there to dry too, walking to the forest and filling the jar with water.<br />
I go back to the beach and place the jar on top of the furnace, waiting for the water to boil, I remove the lid from the furnace.<br />
Then, I grab some soy cane fiber, I start making another basket to store my two cups, my mortar, a jar of mud, and my tools.<br />
After some minutes, I finish making the basket, I walk to the raft and place it on top of it.<br />
Placing it there, I go back to the hut, grabbing my stone knife and some soy cane fiber.<br />
I grab some sticks and go back to the raft, leaving the sticks and stone knife there.<br />
Then I cut two trees, cut them in half, grab more soy cane fiber, and make three more walls on the raft on top of the other three.<br />
I tie them with the soy cane fiber rope, then I place sticks between the two logs of the walls, to prevent the basket from falling on the water or moving.<br />
After that, I do the same for the other basket, to place it in the space that the sticks created.<br />
I tie the five sticks that I placed together, I also make a place for me to put my spear and spear thrower on the left of the raft, on the opposite side of the basket.<br />
Then I go back to the beach, removing the jar of water from the furnace, I drink all of my cup of water.<br />
Drinking it, I go to my hut, grabbing my other cup with its lid, I close both the cups with their lids.<br />
After that, I go back to the raft and place the cups on the basket, I place my mortar and jar of mud there.<br />
Then I make another jar of mud and also a lid, I place both of them on the furnace to dry, I also make a pestle of mud to ground spices and plants.<br />
Waiting for them to dry, I grab my spear, spear thrower, ax, and pestle, leaving them on the basket with the cups on the raft, I leave the spear and its thrower on the left side of the raft.<br />
I go back to the beach and fill the second jar with water, leaving it on top of the furnace.<br />
<br />
I am ready to set sail to some island close to my, I think I am going to the island on the left.<br />
The water boils, I remove the jar from the top of the furnace, close it with the lid, and walk to the raft, storing the jar on the basket.<br />
After that, I go back to the hut, grabbing the first basket with bananas and apples, I go to the raft and place the basket on it.<br />
I grab my ax from the second basket and cut some thin trees, I also grab some sticks to use as fuel if I need to make a fire on the destination island.<br />
Then, I use my stone knife to make some holes on the walls of the raft, placing sticks on them.<br />
Placing the sticks, I make a roof frame with them, tying them together with my soy cane fiber.<br />
I grab some palm tree leaves and place them on top of the frame, making a roof to protect myself from the sun.<br />
After that, I tie the leaves to the sticks using my soy cane fiber.<br />
I also make a place for me to put my oar, and a soy cane fiber rope to lock it in place.<br />
Then, I sit on the raft, it is very firm, I remove the rope from the stick of the raft, which was holding the raft close to the shore of the island.<br />
I grab my oar and place the second basket behind me, on the back of the raft, because it was going to disturb me on rowing on the right side.<br />
After that, I get to the right side of the raft and start rowing in the direction of the island at the left of my island.<br />
Rowing a little, I look to the sky, it looks to be mid-day, I continue rowing, hearing some hawks cheep.<br />
Then, after rowing for some minutes, I am in the middle of my island and the destination island.<br />
I stop to eat one banana and drink some water from my first jar of water.<br />
After that, I continue rowing, it is tough, but a little fun, I already rowed a boat with my father, he taught me when we were making a trip to my grandfather's country house.<br />
It was very fun, my father taught me how to row the boat quickly but strongly, making it go faster.<br />
I sigh and continue rowing, after some minutes, I arrive at the coast of the destination island.<br />
Then, I grab one stick and tie the raft's rope in it, I row a little and place the stick on the sand, trying to lock the raft close to the coast.<br />
After that, I grab my ax and get off the raft, I cut a tree and bury its log on the sand very deep.<br />
I tie the rope of the raft to the log, holding the raft in place, then I grab my stone knife and spear, It is afternoon.<br />
Grabbing them, I walk around the forest of the island, I grab some grass and make some fiber from it.<br />
Then, I make a belt using the grass fiber, to hold my stone knife and my spear, I place the knife on my right and the spear on my left<br />
<br />
I start to walk around the island, looking for fruitful trees and animals, maybe humans.<br />
After walking for a while, I find a banana tree, I grab one banana and eat it.<br />
Walking more, I find a house made of logs, opening its door, I notice that the house is very big.<br />
Some primitive people made this house here some days ago, probably, since it is still up.<br />
Then, I hear a voice behind me, it sounds like a voice of a pre-adult, a boy.<br />
"What are you doing in here?" asks the boy, a little angry.<br />
I turn to see him, I notice that he is Nagai Kei, the boy from the anime called Ajin, I get shocked to see that he exists.<br />
He is angry and haves his spear pointed at me, it has an iron blade.<br />
"S-Sorry, I didn't mean to invade your propriety," I replied, not wanting to cause trouble.<br />
"You understand me? Why you're here?" asks him.<br />
"I just wanted to visit this island, I was at another island, surviving and stuff, I survived from a shipwreck and the water brought me to that island," I reply.<br />
"Oh, okay... What is your name? You're not from the Japanese government right?" asks him, moving his spear closer to me.<br />
"No, dude, I'm from Brazil, I survived from a shipwreck, I'm just a normal person, you can even go see my raft there," I reply, pointing to where my raft was.<br />
"Okay, you didn't tell me your name!" says him.<br />
"I'm Ryan, what is your name?" I ask.<br />
"I'm Nagai... Kei Nagai, so, have you survived for how long on your island?" he says, lowering his spear.<br />
"For only five days, I managed to make some good tools, I have the raft, one oar, two baskets, one with food, and the other one with my tools," I reply.<br />
"Okay, stay there," he says, then he walks to where I said my raft was, then he comes back.<br />
"Well, I think you're not lying right?" asks Nagai.<br />
"No, I'm not," I reply.<br />
"So, I think we can live together and help each other right?" asks him.<br />
"Yes, that would be good, but I would only like to learn with you," I reply.<br />
"Okay, I can teach you some stuff about surviving," he says.<br />
"I would like to know where you got iron and how you heated it to make an iron spear," I say.<br />
"Well, I discovered some iron ores on a cave that I mined, here, I'll show ya," says Nagai.<br />
Then he showed me the cave where he mined his iron, it even had a little gold, silver, and some coal.<br />
He let me use his iron pickax, and mine some iron, silver, and other ores.<br />
Kei Nagai taught me how to heat the ores and use them to make tools.<br />
He let me keep the tools I made using the ores that I mined, it is late afternoon.<br />
I made an iron pickax, shovel, ax, sword, spear, and a bow and arrow, I also made a good iron knife.<br />
I grabbed my raft and placed it ashore, bringing my stuff close to his house, out of the sun.<br />
He taught me how to make a good boat with logs and planks, a lot of space for my stuff, and also two good oars that were fixed at the sides of the boat.<br />
The boy helped me make a log house close to his, we built it together, I was happy, he is very generous.<br />
"What should we call this island?" Kei asks.<br />
"Island of Nagai," I reply.<br />
"Aww, I'm not that important to this island", says him.<br />
"Come on, you discovered it, right?" I ask.<br />
"Yeah, I was the first one to appear here, in the last ten years of course, before that, there were probably other people.<br />
How about Island of Ryan Nagai?" he asks, smiling.<br />
"Yeah, that sounds good, hehe," I reply, smiling.<br />
After some time, it is night, I am at my house, and Kei is at his, our houses are turned to the ocean just like my house at my island.<br />
He has a good ventilation and heating system in his house and helped me make one just like his in my house.<br />
It heats the bed and throws the smoke out of the back of the house, with a little chimney.<br />
We sleep, looking at the ocean and the moon, sleeping calmly and resting well, hearing the ocean waves.<br />
I survived for six days already.
