Chapter 1<br />
---<br />
"In the year of 2019 there was a tale of a spaceship that had an entire house inside it.<br />
That spaceship had a fridge and a bathroom with a laser toilet bowl that melts the things inside it.<br />
And people who got those spaceships were people that just liked to stay in their rooms.<br />
Alone and doing things like using computer and playing video games.<br />
A lot of those people that had spaceships were teens, they were alone and depressive.<br />
By some reason they were teleported to those spaceships.<br />
One of those people was Lisa, a girl of 16 years old.<br />
She played games, used the fridge for eating, wrote stories on her computer.<br />
She lived there, lived her life there doing the stuff she loved to.<br />
She woke up, Lisa had a beautiful room in her spaceship.<br />
A room with pink colors, a computer, an Playstation 4, a fridge, a bathroom with laser toilet bowl.<br />
A bed and a Nintendo 3DS.<br />
She loved to stay there, to write stories, to play games and listen to some dubstep and Japanese songs on her computer.<br />
Today she had nothing to do, but she wanted to play some games.<br />
She turned her computer on and sat on the chair, she then opened Steam and waited for it to open.<br />
She opened Titanfall 2 to play a little.<br />
She loved that game, she entered a multi-player match.<br />
She made a 10/3, she liked that match.<br />
Then she closed Steam and opened Firefox and Spotify.<br />
She selected a Dubstep song to blast on her speakers.<br />
Then she opened Facebook to talk with her friends.<br />
She talked with her friend Anny.<br />
"How are you Anny?", said Lisa.<br />
"I'm good, and you?", said Anny.<br />
"I'm good too, what are you doing right now?", said Lisa.<br />
"Playing God of War in my PS4", said Anny.<br />
"Oh, that's cool, I'm gonna make something else right now", said Lisa.<br />
"Ok", said Anny.<br />
Then Lisa turned her PS4 on and grabbed the controller.<br />
She also opened her Music player on her computer which was named Foobar and closed Spotify.<br />
She had lots of GBs of music, she liked to have such a big library.<br />
Then Lisa opened GTA V and started playing, she played the online mode.<br />
She was playing with her friends, also she was listening to the song "Geoxor - Turn Around" in her music player.<br />
She liked that song, Lisa had two monitors, one for the computer and one for the PS4.<br />
Lisa noticed she was hungry, she became afk in the game and placed her controller in the desk.<br />
She got up and opened the fridge, it was an automatic fridge that brought anything the person wants.<br />
You could think of a pizza and a pizza would appear inside the fridge.<br />
Then Lisa grabbed the cup of chocolate milk that was in the fridge.<br />
And also the hamburger, she sat at her desk.<br />
Lisa also liked to watch movies.<br />
And series, anime, cartoons.<br />
She downloads that stuff with utorrent.<br />
After some time playing she said to her friends that she was going to do another thing.<br />
She liked Marvel and its movies, she had downloaded "The Avengers: Infinite War".<br />
She grabbed a bowl of Doritos and a bottle of Coca-cola to watch the movie.<br />
She opened her video player that was called VLC Media Player.<br />
Lisa opened the mkv file of Infinite War in the video player.<br />
And then she watched the movie, she loved the movie, all the action and stuff, the heroes.<br />
Then after sometime she got tired and turned her computer and PS4 off.<br />
Her body was tired, she laid in her bed and slept, she had a dream.<br />
Where she was going to school, and also had to clean her room and house of her parents.<br />
Lisa also had to work, for her that dream was a nightmare.<br />
Then after sometime that dream disappeared and another dream took its place, a better dream.<br />
She was dreaming of being in her computer listening to dubstep songs and talking to her friends on Discord.<br />
She liked that dream, and wanted to wake up just to use Discord and talk to her friends.<br />
Lisa liked what she had, that spaceship, the bed, computer, PS4 and Nintendo 3DS.<br />
She wanted to play, to watch, to write and to talk.<br />
She wanted to be alone, and to have her things to do.<br />
And that is her life."<br /><br />

<h5 class="w3-text-blue"><hr class="slhr" />
Chapter 2<br />
---<br />
"Still in the year of 2019 there was this tale, of a super innovative spaceship.<br />
The company that made those spaceships was called by the name ThinkOutsiteTheBox.<br />
The spaceships were called "LonelyShips", because you were lonely there.<br />
There was a lot of people that lived in the LonelyShips, they created a community.<br />
And a lot of Discord servers to communicate and talk about being a LonelyShipper.<br />
It was like a movement, a social movement, just like the bronies, furries and 4channers were some years ago.<br />
These three specific movements are still active, but they aren't as famous as before.<br />
They liked to be in that movement, Lisa didn't participated in that.<br />
She was just her, spending her own time at the computer, without a movement or stereotype.<br />
There was also a boy named John, he had 17 years old, he liked to play games.<br />
A lot of games, he was very competitive at them, and didn't liked to loose.<br />
He was at his LonelyShip, he didn't knew what time was on earth.<br />
He only wanted to play games, he was thinking some things while being laid at his bed.<br />
He thought: "Why I am at this bed?, I was really alone, and I wanted to stay away from the others,<br />
Because they enraged me, I was suffering because of them, and I was being annoyed by them too,<br />
Also I feel that I was someone in another place or alternate universe,<br />
Like I was some kind of hero or teacher of martial arts, like I was teaching some friends,<br />
And was teaching two persons, Juju and Sizaque I think,<br />
I should stop think about that, maybe I'm too tired or something, I should get back to the computer".<br />
Then John got off his bed and turned the computer on, he opened Steam to play some games.<br />
John also had a friend called Mark, John felt that they were friends on a alternate universe.<br />
John opened Apex Legends to play, it was a new game that EA launched, he wanted to test it.<br />
He played for a few minutes and liked, he was very good at the game.<br />
Then he closed the game and called his friend Mark to play some Overwatch on Discord.<br />
They played a little while talking by voice-call, Mark also lived in a LonelyShip.<br />
After some time playing John won some rounds and wanted to exit, he said "See you later" to Mark.<br />
Mark said the same, John liked to read some stories on the internet, he wanted to write too.<br />
But he wasn't very good at it, he liked to read the stories of a girl named Lisa, that was a LonelyShipper too.<br />
Lisa has published a lot of stories, she loved to write those ones.<br />
John was studying writing and history to learn a little, he has made some drafts on his computer.<br />
He wanted to talk to Lisa, to ask her for help on writing, he noticed that she puts her Discord name and id in all of her stories.<br />
The text said: "If you want help in writing or like my stories and want to talk about them just add me on Discord: Lisa#3860".<br />
Then John added her on Discord, John already liked and commented on the chapters of some stories of Lisa.<br />
But he wanted to talk to her and to ask questions to her, about writing and how to write better.<br />
--(Author: And what I'm doing right now?, writing, inception.)<br />
John sent a message to her, he said: "Hi, how are you?, I'm John from Wattpad, I love your stories".<br />
"You wrote your Discord on your stories right?, you said people could ask for help in writing or talk about your stories".<br />
"Sorry for asking so many questions, Its that I started just some months ago, and was trying to get better at writing".<br />
After sometime John noticed that she was online, he got excited to receive a reply.<br />
Lisa replied: "Hey, John, I know you from Wattpad :), you comment and give me a lot of likes, thanks for loving my stories,<br />
And thanks for commenting and liking them, yes, I did that, you can ask for help or talk with me about my stories :3,<br />
Its ok asking questions, I started some months ago too, can I see a piece of your work?, like, the story you're most proud of".<br />
Them John replied: "Yes, I will send a text file, ok?".<br />
"Ok then", said Lisa.<br />
Then John sent Lisa a file named "The Return of the Beast.txt" of 4KB.<br />
After some time reading Lisa started writing a message to John, she said:<br />
"That was cool to read, the story was interesting, but the way you executed it, that was a little..."<br />
John: "Bad?".<br />
Lisa: "Not bad, but, was not... the way you express yourself, or the way you write, like, try to read more".<br />
Lisa: "Try to read more and to learn more how to use words, and how to form phrases, I guess that's my Monika Tip-".<br />
Lisa: "I mean, I guess that's my tip for you, try that".<br />
John: "Ok, I will try that, thanks for helping me, like, I was scared and excited to talk to you".<br />
Lisa: "Why?".<br />
John: "Cause I loved your work, and thought you were an inaccessible person".<br />
Lisa: "If I were inaccessible why I would put my discord tag in my stories?, also I live in a LonelyShip, so I'm very accessible".<br />
John: "Oh, that's cool, I live in one too, what is your age?".<br />
Lisa: "16, and you?, my name is Lisa btw".<br />
John: "17, my name is John".<br />
Lisa: "Ok John, I liked to talk to you, but I'm gonna write some "The Odds of Nature" right now, ok?".<br />
John: "Ok, sorry to bother you".<br />
Lisa: "You Didn't bothered me, also I want to read your stories when you get better :)".<br />
John: "It would be an honor to send you some of them :D".<br />
Lisa: "Ok, see you later John :3".<br />
John: "See you later Lisa :)".<br />
After that John minimized his Discord and started searching how to write better and how to use words better.<br />
He wanted to get better at writing to show Lisa his stories, he was super excited to do that.<br />
He learned a lot, and was trying to make some drafts.<br />
After some time writing he wrote something that he liked, he was tired, he yawned and relaxed back in the chair.<br />
He turned off his computer and laid in bed to sleep, he wanted to talk to Lisa again.<br />
He slept."<br /><br />

Chapter 3<br />
---<br />
"John woke up and turned his computer on, he opened the fridge and picked up a lemon cake.<br />
He placed the plate with the lemon cake in the table where the computer was.<br />
He opened Steam to play some games, he played Transport Defender and Zombidle for 30 minutes.<br />
After that he opened Notepad++ to write some stories, or maybe one draft that he was trying to make better.<br />
He worked a little on it and thought it was good, he saved the file, then after he downloaded some videos of Youtube to watch.<br />
He downloaded 3 videos of Alanzoka and 3 of Cellbit Jogando.<br />
John had a site where he placed the videos and a green button called "Watch" was added linking to his local video file.<br />
He watched some videos and then closed the tab of the site, he used VLC Media Player to watch those videos.<br />
John also liked to play Minecraft, he had 3 servers in his Minecraft Server List.<br />
He liked to play survival and skyblock on those servers, John liked the "Fanbase" of those servers.<br />
John played a little in those servers, he had friends there.<br />
He closed the game and started to talk to his friends in Discord, he liked the friends he had.<br />
It was 11:00AM there, but he didn't know the difference between day and night because he didn't have light or a sun close to there.<br />
Then the scene changed to Lisa, she was writing The Odds of Nature, she finished the current chapter and saved.<br />
After that she posted her story to Wattpad, after some minutes the chapter had 5 views and 2 comments.<br />
Lisa was happy about that, she liked to have a fanbase or to have people that liked to read what she write.<br />
After that, Lisa opened Netflix to watch some series, she liked to watch The Walking Dead.<br />
Lisa was in the second episode of the seventh season, she liked the story and the characters, but also was a little scared to watch.<br />
The Discord app was open on her computer, when she started watching The Walking Dead S07E03, the details of what she was watching appeared on her Discord profile.<br />
She paused the video playback and got some popcorn and coca-cola from her fridge, she liked to eat popcorn while watching things,<br />
Then she sat at her chair and played the video, she ate while watching, then the episode ended, she closed the Netflix app.<br />
Then Lisa switched to Discord, she wanted to talk with her friends on Discord, she noticed that John was online.<br />
Lisa started to talk with him, she said: "Hi, you got better at writing?".<br />
After some time John replied saying: "Yes, I searched on the internet how to get better at writing, I wrote a draft today".<br />
Then Lisa said: "Oh, that's cool, can I see it?".<br />
John said: "Yes, of course, I will send the file to you?, ok?".<br />
Then Lisa replied: "Ok".<br />
John sent her a file named: "Bubbles and Creams.txt" of 5KB.<br />
Lisa said: "I will read this now".<br />
After some time Lisa replied saying: "I think this is better than the other story you sent me, like... the way you wrote it".<br />
"The grammar is better too, I liked the story, I think the concept is interesting, you should publish it somewhere, like Wattpad".<br />
"I would be happy to read it on Wattpad :)".<br />
Then John replied: "Oh, ok, I'm happy that you think that about my story, I tried to get better at writing just because I admire you so much".<br />
"And I wanted to make you proud of me or something, so thanks for liking my story, and thanks for helping me get better at writing".<br />
"I will post it on Wattpad, thanks for the suggestion".<br />
Then Lisa replied: "Oh, I'm happy to help you and to inspire you too, thanks for that :)".<br />
"I'm gonna make something else now, ok, see you later :3".<br />
Then John replied: "See you later".<br />
Lisa was so happy that she inspired John to get better at writing, that made her want to do more stories, and to write more.<br />
Then Lisa opened Steam to play some games, she opened Apex Legends to play a little.<br />
She liked the game, she wanted to play more, but was a little tired to play.<br />
She won a match and closed the game, she had other friends on Discord too.<br />
Lisa wanted to talk to Anny, to play a little and stuff, Anny had a Discord too.<br />
Then Lisa sent a message to Anny on Discord saying: "Hey, want to play a little today?".<br />
Then Anny replied: "Yes, I would like to do that, but what you want to play?".<br />
Lisa said: "I don't know, just a little GTA V, or Terraria if you want".<br />
Anny said: "I would like to play both".<br />
Then Lisa and Anny entered a private server on Discord to go on a voice-call, Lisa called a Music Bot to the voice-call to listen to some music while playing.<br />
Lisa and Anny played GTA V Online a little, they liked that game, then after that Lisa said that she was going to do something else.<br />
Lisa was looking into Wattpad for some stories to read, she discovered that the "Life of Littletato" received a new chapter, the Chapter 18.<br />
The story was written by a user called "2ekats", Lisa liked that story, she liked to see Littletato and Julia living their lives.<br />
She loved the chapter she gave it a vote and commented on it, after some minutes the author replied her saying:<br />
"Hi, thanks for voting on my story, and thanks for liking and commenting on it, I'm really happy to see your feedback and your comments".<br />
Lisa was happy to give feedback and to comment on the stories she liked.<br />
Then she turned her Playstation 4 on and opened a game called Need For Speed, she liked to play that.<br />
Lisa played for some time and closed the game, she turned her video game off.<br />
She felt hungry, she opened the fridge and there was a packet of chocolate stuffed biscuit and a Doritos on there, also a cup of coca-cola.<br />
Lisa picked up all the things and placed them on her table, she opened the packet of biscuit and she dropped them on a plastic bowl.<br />
She opened a movie on Netflix to watch, the movie was called "The Avengers: Infinite War".<br />
She watched while eating the biscuits, Doritos and drinking coca-cola, she liked the movie, and she added it to her list of "Watched Movies".<br />
Lisa loved to make text files, she had a friend called Funkysnipa Cat, she knew him on Google+.<br />
Funkysnipa Cat was the first to start the conversation on Discord, Funkysnipa Cat and Lisa were native speakers of the Brazilian Portuguese language.<br />
Funkysnipa Cat said in Brazilian Portuguese: "Hi".<br />
Then Lisa said: "Hi".<br />
They talked a little and started to know each other again, they liked to talk about stories, they had a lot in common.<br />
Funky and Lisa loved to write stories, and Lisa wanted to write together with Funky some time.<br />
The real name of Funky was Izaque, Lisa liked to be his friend.<br />
After some time learning about each other, Izaque discovered that Lisa lived in a LonelyShip.<br />
Izaque lived in the normal Planet Earth, Izaque thought that was an interesting fact about Lisa.<br />
On the beginning of the conversation Izaque sent Lisa the link of his Wattpad profile, Lisa and Izaque talked about stories for a while.<br />
They also played together some times, actually the author of this story is Izaque or Funkysnipa Cat.<br />
Yes, that's it, I'm Izaque and I'm writing about Lisa, my dear friend, that's a little weird to do right?.<br />
Because a lot of stories don't talk with the reader, they tell a story to the reader, but its simply that, I'm writing a story about my friend Lisa.<br />
I'm thinking you probably have a face like this now: "O_O".<br />
Back to Narrator style.<br />
Lisa said to Izaque what she did on the days she spent on that spaceship, so he could write the Chapters of the story "SpaceLiving".<br />
Izaque loved to write that story (*wink*).<br />
Izaque analyzed the day of Lisa and wrote a story about that, then he sent the story file to Lisa.<br />
Lisa liked and gave permission to Izaque to publish the story and to send the story to his friends.<br />
Izaque loved when a specific friend read SpaceLiving, that friend was more than a friend, that person was called [...] (...).<br />
Lisa loved to talk to Izaque, Lisa also knew that [...] liked to read her story.<br />
Lisa wanted to talk to her, Lisa asked for the contact of [...], Izaque said that she could talk to [...].<br />
Then [...] started the conversation with Lisa, they talked a little, Isa started to know Lisa a little more.<br />
Then after some time they stopped talking.<br />
Lisa thought that she had a happy life, she wrote stories, she had some good friends like Izaque, Isa and John.<br />
She felt tired, she said goodbye to Izaque and turned the computer off.<br />
She then laid on her bed and slept."<br /><br />

Chapter 4<br />
---<br />
"There was a boy that lived in a LonelyShip too, his name was "Ted".<br />
But his spaceship was different, it had a teletransporter.<br />
He could go back to Earth when he wanted to.<br />
To see his family, and to know about the news of the Earth.<br />
He was a little famous in his city, being one of the only people who could leave their LonelyShips.<br />
He liked his life, he was still a civilian on Earth, but he liked to live in his LonelyShip.<br />
One day he was sat in his computer, eating some lasagna with coca-cola while watching a livestream of the Youtuber Cellbit.<br />
Then after eating he got up and picked up a bottle of water, he placed the bottle on the table.<br />
Ted then dragged the livestream window to his second screen, and opened Netflix on the Mozilla Firefox browser.<br />
He took a look at the catalog, he didn't found anything that he was interested to watch.<br />
Then he closed the browser and the livestream, and opened Steam to play some games, he started playing Terraria.<br />
He played on a multi-player server, he played for a little and then closed the game.<br />
Ted missed his family and the life in Earth, he turned off his computer and activated the teletransporter.<br />
After waiting some time, the teletransporter was ready, he entered it and typed the id of Planet Earth.<br />
He has been teleported to Earth, and appeared on the house of his parents.<br />
His parents were eating, they noticed that Ted was there, they got up to hug Ted.<br />
The parents of Ted said they missed him, and they cried a little together.<br />
Then his parents said they were gonna go to the market.<br />
The parents of Ted left the house and Ted said he was going to downtown.<br />
Ted locked the house and got a backpack with somethings.<br />
After walking a little Ted arrived at downtown, he wanted to see a friend of him.<br />
That he talked with in the internet, he also had a smartphone on his LonelyShip.<br />
His dad was called Pedro, his mom was called Jana.<br />
Ted meet his friend 2 years ago.<br />
His friend was a girl called Monika, he knew where she lived.<br />
Ted sent a message to Monika through his smartphone saying that he was coming to her house.<br />
Monika said she was happy about that, and that she was excited to see him again.<br />
Then Ted started walking to her house, he arrived and knocked on the door.<br />
Monika then opened the door and let Ted in.<br />
Then Monika told Ted to feel at home.<br />
Ted entered the house and sat on the couch.<br />
Monika asked if he wanted some water, Ted replied positively.<br />
Then Monika brought a glass of water.<br />
Ted drank it and gave it back to Monika.<br />
Monika then came back to the kitchen and placed the cup on the sink.<br />
Monika came back to the living room and sat at the couch.<br />
Ted was a little uncomfortable because of that.<br />
He wasn't used to being so close to a person like that.<br />
Then Monika asked how he was doing, Ted said he was doing great.<br />
Monika said that she liked him, they both looked in the eyes of each other.<br />
Ted was blushing a little and said that he liked Monika too.<br />
Then Ted asked if Monika liked to live that way, in Earth.<br />
Monika was a little uncomfortable about that question.<br />
She took a while to reply.<br />
Then Monika said she liked that, but she would like to live as a LonelyShipper.<br />
Ted asked if she wanted to spend some time there.<br />
Monika said she wanted, but she was afraid of letting her house alone.<br />
Then Ted said that she could call someone trustworthy to take care of the house.<br />
Monika said that that was a good idea, then she said that she was going to think about that for a while.<br />
Ted said that was good to see her again, and that she was still beautiful.<br />
Monika blushed a little and said "Thank you!".<br />
Then Monika said that he was beautiful too.<br />
Ted said "Thank you...".<br />
Monika said: "You don't want to stay for a coffee?".<br />
Ted replied: "Oh, okay".<br />
Then Monika got up and walked towards the kitchen, she started making coffee.<br />
Ted sat at the chair and waited for Monika to prepare the coffee.<br />
They talked a little and then the coffee was ready.<br />
Monika and Ted sat at the table and Monika poured some coffee and milk for Ted.<br />
Ted said: "Hmm... I wanna ask you something".<br />
Then Monika said: "Which is?".<br />
Ted said: "A pretty girl like you must have a boyfriend right?".<br />
Then Monika replied blushed and shy: "Oh... haha, thank you Ted but I don't have a boyfriend".<br />
Ted said: "Oh... so... we already know each other a lot right?".<br />
Monika said: "Y-yes... and I really like you...".<br />
Ted said: "Me too...".<br />
Monika got closer to Ted and said: "So... do you like me more than a friend?...".<br />
Ted said: "What that would mean?...".<br />
Monika said: "That... like... as a girlfriend?".<br />
Ted was a little shy and said: "Uhh... maybe... like... do you want to be my girlfriend?".<br />
Monika blushed and said: "Y-yes...".<br />
Then Ted hugged Monika, Monika kissed Ted.<br />
Monika said: "I want to go with you to your LonelyShip...".<br />
Ted said: "You're sure about that?".<br />
Monika said: "Yes!, I love you!".<br />
Ted said: "I love you too honey, I'm happy that you want to live with me".<br />
Monika said: "I'm happy too".<br />
Then Monika started packing up her things.<br />
Monika gave her house to a relative and picked up the 30.000 dollars she had in a bank account.<br />
Then Monika came to the house of Ted and they were prepared to teleport to the LonelyShip.<br />
They teleported and got off the teletransporter. <br />
When Monika got off the teletransporter the spaceship began to shake a little and the tables and walls were moving and changing.<br />
After sometime a new computer, PS4, bed, bathroom and fridge was there.<br />
Monika placed her stuff on the floor and got closer to the bed, on the wall of the bed was some buttons.<br />
She pushed a pink button and the bed, fridge, table and walls got painted pink.<br />
Monika said: "This is awesome", and hugged Ted.<br />
Ted said: "Yes, it is!".<br />
There was also a wardrobe there, Monika stored her things there.<br />
She laid on her bed and said: "This spaceship is really cool".<br />
Ted said: "Yea".<br />
Monika was prepared to start a new life in that spaceship, doing a lot of things and being with her love.<br />
Ted said: "This isn't a LonelyShip anymore, its a LovelyShip, haha".<br />

<i>*The message disappears...*</i><br />
A LonelyShipper was seeing this message, she was in her LonelyShip, the walls of the spaceship had the Navy Blue color,<br />
She had a Bed, ThoughtPoweredFridge, Bathroom, a Computer, Smartphone and PS4, she also had a Musical Keyboard,<br />
She loved to learn and train with the keyboard, she was very good at it, some time she sent a cover of the song "Faded" to a friend,<br />
That friend was called Izaque, Izaque liked the music cover, and said that Wendy had talent,<br />
Wendy was very happy reading that, Wendy also liked to play some games on her computer,<br />
She loved to eat too, because it was easy to eat on a LonelyShip, you just think about the food, open the Fridge and the food will be there,<br />
Izaque liked to write some stories, he would sent the link of a new chapter to Wendy every time he made one,<br />
Wendy liked to read the stories of Izaque, Izaque thought that Wendy was a really good friend, and he liked to talk to her,<br />
They talked using Discord, when Izaque learned that Wendy was a LonelyShipper too, he became happier than before,<br />
Izaque loved his LonelyShip, Wendy too, Izaque loved to listen to some Dubstep in his Ship, blasting it on the speakers,<br />
Izaque also made livestreams on Twitch, showing what he was doing, to his subscribers,<br />
He liked to download songs from SoundCloud, to play games on Steam, to write stories and post on Wattpad, Fanfiction and in the sites that he made by himself,<br />
Wendy liked to listen to some chill music, and to watch videos on Youtube, <br />
One day Izaque was reading a really good and atmospheric story on the Fimfiction website,<br />
It was about the My Little Pony cartoon and the Don't Starve game together, he recommended the story to Wendy,<br />
He liked so much those two things, and those things together were better than anything,<br />
There was one day where Izaque didn't made a livestream, he watched a movie called The Avengers: Infinite War,<br />
He ate pizzas, hamburgers and lots of coca-cola while watching the two hour movie,<br />
He loved to do that, watch that awesome movie, Izaque added the movie to his watched list on his website called Watch History,<br />
Izaque also used a software on his computer called Foobar2000, which was a Music Player, Izaque had 25Gigabytes of music on his hard drive,<br />
He liked to have a lot of music, and he called himself a Music Hoarder,<br />
Izaque was also a friend of one of the founders of ThinkOutsideTheBox, he liked the new Update they made to the LonelyShips,<br />

Izaque sure loved to be a LonelyShipper and to live in a LonelyShip,<br />
He even created a Discord Server about it, and talked to a lot of friends on Discord about how to become a LonelyShipper,<br />
Wendy also liked to sleep, and to play some keyboard on her spaceship, she loved to be a LonelyShipper,<br />
Back when she was still in earth, she wanted to live alone, she liked to use the computer and smartphone,<br />
She liked to see the stars, the planets and the earth from her window,<br />
Wendy had some luck too, because no asteroids crossed the way of her spaceship,<br />
Izaque had an asteroid coming in the direction of his spaceship, then the security system activated and a big laser turret appeared in the top of the spaceship,<br />
Destroying the asteroid completely, Izaque wasn't scared by the asteroid, because he knew how the spaceship worked, and knewthat it would protect him,<br />
He loved to study and to learn about the LonelyShips, SpaceLiving and the ThinkOutsideTheBox company,<br />
With the new update 1.3.709, Izaque and Wendy could visit their families, they liked that, to see them again,<br />
Izaque missed his family, he hugged all of them, his sisters, his brother, his father and mother,<br />
He was used to being in earth and to talk to humans, even if he had spent a lot of time inside the LonelyShip,<br />
Izaque asked if someone wanted to live there with him, but no one wanted,<br />
Then he said "See you later" to all of them, he came inside the Teleporter that was in the house of his parents,<br />
And came back to the LonelyShip, a robot female voice greeted him, saying: "Welcome back, Izaque",<br />
Izaque installed that voice using the Desktop App "SpaceLiving ThinkOutsideTheBox",<br />
The spaceship of Izaque already had a lot of good things and good equipment, a good screen, PS4,<br />
Good computer, good internet, he was happy with what he had,<br />
He wanted to talk more with Lisa, Wendy, Igor and other friends he had on Discord,<br />
He wanted to talk more in the "Discord do Cellbit" server,<br />
Izaque was tired, he listened to some Dubstep music on his computer, then watched a small episode of the anime Eromanga Sensei while eating chocolate cookies,<br />
He added the episode to his Watched List and turned off the computer, he laid in his bed and slept."<br /><br />

Chapter 6<br />
---<br />
(This is the explanation of a... let me create a cool name for that... a "SpaceLivingTeleportExperience")<br />
It was a beautiful day in the SpaceLiving world, even if there's no sun close to the spaceships.<br />
Lisa, Izaque, Wendy, John, Ted and Monika were all inside their spaceships, living happy and using the computer.<br />
Lisa was drawing a little while watching an anime called "Eromanga Sensei", she felt inspired by that, because it had an girl that drew too.<br />
She was happy drawing while watching her favorite anime, it was funny, cute, happy, she loved it.<br />
The anime tell the story of a little sister that draw erotic drawings, and an older brother that write stories and light novels.<br />
Lisa loved to watch that anime, she was re watching it for the twenty-third time.<br />
She had it download in HD on her computer, just to watch again and again.<br />
The anime reminded her of her older brother, she loved him very much.<br />
But then she got depressed, sad and just wanted to stay in her room, he was sad about that.<br />
She was hungry all day, but didn't had the motivation to eat.<br />
She just stayed on her room, the lights were dimmed out, she was doing things at her computer.<br />
Then she reached a point in her life that she was weak and skinny, she realized that her life was bad.<br />
Lisa wanted to get out of there, she was afraid, she wanted to go to school just to make her parents happy.<br />
Her family was sad about her, she wanted to get out of there, when she slept, was 05:12 in the morning.<br />
She was sleeping in her bed, she had a dream, a dream where she got teleported to a spaceship that had white walls.<br />
A Computer, PS4, a Fridge that creates any food you think about, a bed, a wardrobe, a smartphone on the table.<br />
She thought that was incredible and awesome, to have all the things you need to use the computer.<br />
To have food and water when you want, and to have a super-good computer.<br />
She wanted to stay there forever, her eyes were shining bright.<br />
Everything was new to her, she got closer to the table and turned the computer on by pressing the button on the computer cabinet.<br />
It loaded Windows 10, it was as if she had formatted the computer, she typed the name of the user.<br />
A password, and then the Windows 10 home screen appeared, it had Mozilla Firefox, Spotify, Windows Explorer and the SpaceLiving Desktop App installed.<br />
She opened Firefox, the home page was DuckDuckGo, the favorites of the browser were: DuckDuckGo, YouTube, Facebook, SoundCloud, SuperAnimes, Wattpad, MyAnimeList.<br />
She opened YouTube and logged in her account.<br />
Then Lisa opened DuckDuckGo and download Youtube-DLG, it was an app that she used in her personal computer.<br />
The computer also had Steam installed, Lisa logged in her Steam account.<br />
She opened Windows Explorer, she saw that the computer had 5 SSDs, each one with 10TB of space.<br />
Her eyes shined bright seeing that, because she only had 500GB of HD in her computer.<br />
She switched to Steam and told her to download all the games she had.<br />
Then Lisa opened the Mega website, she logged into her account and downloaded the app, she installed it and put it to download all of her 2TB of files.<br />
She was loving that, setting up and organizing her new space of work.<br />
After letting Steam and Mega do their jobs, Lisa was a little hungry, she got closer to the fridge, and a screen that was attached to it lighted up.<br />
It showed a lot of text, like if it was a tutorial on how to use the fridge, Lisa thought it was pretty intuitive.<br />
She learned how to use the fridge, she thought about pizza, then opened the fridge, and a slice of pizza was there.<br />
Lisa thought it was amazing, she closed the fridge, thought about a coca-cola and opened the fridge.<br />
A can of coca cola was there, she grabbed it and closed the fridge.<br />
She came back to the computer table and laid the pizza and can in the top of the table.<br />
Lisa started organizing her Mega files, she liked to make websites, she had a website were she made a history of what she watched.<br />
She downloaded some anime on a website called SuperAnimes, Lisa had downloaded the first episode of the anime "Eromanga Sensei".<br />
Lisa thought it was interesting, and wanted to give it a try.<br />
She started watching it while eating the pizza and drinking the coca cola, she loved doing that.<br />
Lisa added the episode to her watch history and to her AniCartoMovie.txt file, she cleaned her hands and her mouth.<br />
Then she realized she forgot something, "Discord!, I forgot it", she thought, Lisa downloaded Discord and logged in her account.<br />
She was so happy to download it again, and use it again, she thought that was a dream.<br />
Lisa knew that Google+ was going to die soon, she was sad about that, but she was happy about starting that new but not so new life of hers.<br />
She had a special friend on Google+, that friend was called Funkysnipa Cat or Izaque in real life.<br />
She loved to talk with that friend, she opened Hangouts and asked for his Discord name and id.<br />
Izaque gave it to her, she added him on Discord and they started talking, Lisa wanted to know him more.<br />
They talked a lot, and knew a lot more about each other, Lisa was happy talking with Izaque.<br />
Lisa wanted to express herself better, and write something, she wanted to write words in her computer.<br />
Then she talked with Izaque about that, Izaque suggested for Lisa to start writing stories.<br />
She liked the idea, Izaque said for Lisa to download Notepad++, he said that its a good program for writing.<br />
Lisa downloaded the program and started her first draft of a story, she wrote for some minutes.<br />
She liked the result, then saved the file and sent it to her Mega cloud.<br />
Izaque said for her to post her story on Wattpad, because it was a good platform for writers.<br />
Lisa created an account there and posted her story, the name of the story was "The Odds of Nature".<br />
After waiting some time Lisa reloaded the page and there were 10 views in it, and a comment.<br />
The author of the comment was "stake2", Lisa switched to Discord and asked if Izaque had a Wattpad account.<br />
Izaque said yes, Lisa came back to Firefox to read the comment, stake2 was complimenting the story of Lisa, she was happy about that.<br />
She liked the comment and replied thanking stake2, she was really happy about that comment.<br />
Then Lisa switched to Discord and asked for the link of the account of Izaque on Wattpad.<br />
Izaque sent the link to Lisa, surprisingly was stake2, Lisa was really happy about that.<br />
She switched to Discord to thank Izaque for that, Lisa said she loved to write the first chapter.<br />
Izaque said: "I started like that, well, I wrote Ilha Deserta, I wasn't really happy about that story, it was my first story."<br />
Then Izaque said: "I made Ilha Deserta in 2016, when I was reading a really cool futuristic story, I was happy about the feeling that writing gave me,<br />
then I never stopped till today."<br />
Lisa said: "Oh, I'm happy to know that, I love to write, I will read your story called "Life of Littletato", I liked to know how your started writing,<br />
thanks for teaching me a lot about writing."<br />
Then Izaque said: "I don't know much, but thanks for listening, learning and saying that my knowledge was helpful :), hehe, I like you a lot Lisa :3."<br />
Lisa said: "I like you a lot too Izaque, hehe :3."<br />
Then Steam finished downloading all the games of Lisa, she wanted to play one, she opened Grand Theft Auto 5 to play a little.<br />
She had some mods installed, she loved to play that game, to drive cars and stuff.<br />
Lisa played a little and stopped, she closed the game, she was hungry again, she got up and thought about a hamburger and a coca cola.<br />
She opened the fridge and there was, a hamburger in a plate and a can of coca cola. <br />
Lisa downloaded an episode of the sixth season of the series "The Walking Dead", she waited for it to be downloaded and opened it in VLC Media Player.<br />
She thought was weird to eat while watching that series, but she couldn't handle her hunger, so she watched while eating.<br />
It was sad to watch that series, sometimes people die, and you end the episode being sad.<br />
She finished watching and eating, she added the episode to her watch history.<br />
She felt tired, and she wanted to use the bathroom, she used it and came to her bed, she laid on her bed and tried to close her eyes.<br />
Lisa thought: "This is really a dream?, it looks very real...", then Lisa tries to pinch herself.<br />
She didn't woke up, she was surprised by that.<br />
Then Lisa slept, waiting to go more at the computer."<br /><br />

Chapter 7<br />
---<br />
[In the last chapter, Lisa was not dreaming, she actually teleported to the SpaceShip, it wasn't a dream]<br />
Another day in the SpaceLiving world, a rumor about a group spaceship was circulating, 4 friends who were so close and knew each other so well.<br />
They were teleported to the spaceship together, this rumor was spreading quickly, the users of the LonelyShips were talking a lot about it.<br />
They created theories and groups, fake Discord accounts about it.<br />
There was also a story, created and written by a user on Discord and Wattpad, called stake2.<br />
It was about the actions and the life of that specific group in their LonelyShip.<br />
The name of the group was... Gang Da Suruba.<br />
Some people thought that stake2 was a resident on the spaceship of Gang Da Suruba(GDS), because the story had many details.<br />
At some time, on 2019 or 2020, I think.<br />
4 friends sent messages in the official SpaceLiving Discord Server.<br />
Their names were Drag, Manuh, Funkysnipa Cat and kendrinhah.<br />
One of the members sent a selfie of the group, it was Manuh.<br />
Manuh and Drag were fighting in the back of the picture.<br />
Kendra was taking the picture and Funkysnipa Cat was just headbanging to dubstep in the bed.<br />
The users that were looking at the chat started to talk about it.<br />
One said: "They are the rare group that was teleported to a LonelyShip!".<br />
John was there too, he said: "Oh, I would like to live in a spaceship with my friends".<br />
Funkysnipa Cat said: "And that is me, headbanging to dubstep in the bed".<br />
Drag said: "I'm fighting in the back of the pic with Manuh".<br />
kendrinhah said: "And I'm taking the pic".<br />
A random user said: "This is the first pic of a spaceship, we never saw a picture of a LonelyShip".<br />
Ted said: "Yea, that's right, someone gotta tell ThinkOutsideTheBox".<br />
A SpaceLiving Admin said: "They already know about that, since they have enabled that feature, only for that specific group,<br />
So they should feel special".<br />
Ted said: "Oh, okay then, they should feel happy".<br />
The Admin said: "Yea...".<br />
After some time people stopped talking about them, a member of the group began to stream on Twitch.<br />
Showing his things, how he wrote stories, and surprisingly, Funkysnipa Cat was also stake2.<br />
And the story was real, the story was about the group of Gang Da Suruba.<br />
The people watching asked a lot of questions to stake2, what was his name, he replied that his name was Izaque.<br />
Manuh, Drag and Kendra entered the room of Izaque, one at a time, to present themselves for Izaque's viewers.<br />
After a while Izaque closed the livestream, he wanted to sleep a little, he closed the door and laid on his bed.<br />
Kendra was sleeping too, Izaque dreamed a little, thinking that he loved to live there with his friends.<br />
On the next day, Izaque woke up and opened his door, he turned on his computer and saw an announcement on the Official SpaceLiving Discord Server.<br />
It was a notification saying that on that day, at 18:00 all LonelyShippers or LonelyShip residents were going to be teleported to a big SpaceShip.<br />
To make a party, also because of that specific event (the GDS group), for the LonelyShippers to know other LonelyShippers.<br />
Izaque told Drag, Kendra and Manuh about that, Manuh said in Brazilian Portuguese:<br />
"Mas eles não podem simplesmente nos teleportar pra lá, e se alguém não quiser ir?".<br />
("But they can't just simply teleport us to there, and if there's someone who don't want to go?").<br />
Izaque said in Brazilian Portuguese: "Bom... eles fizeram isso pra nós trazer pra cá kk".<br />
("Well... they made that to bring us here xD").<br />
Manuh replied: "Até que faz sentido" ("Well that makes sense").<br />
After some time, it was 18:00, the LonelyShippers looked at their computer clocks, they suddenly were floating, then all of them appeared on a single spaceship.<br />
Everyone looked at each other, Ted was close to Monika, John smiled at Lisa and Lisa smiled back, Izaque hugged Lisa and Lisa accepted the hug.<br />
Kendra was a little jealous because of that, Izaque then smiled at Wendy and Wendy smiled back.<br />
Manuh told Kendra that if she was her, she would get mad at Wendy and Lisa.<br />
Kendra thought she was not that angry or wasn't so extreme as Manuh.<br />
Izaque talked a little with Lisa, Wendy, John, Ted, Monika, he loved to talk face to face with people he talked through the internet.<br />
Wendy and Lisa were so happy about that, everyone was chatting, it was an awesome sight, a lot of people with lots of stuff in common.<br />
Talking a lot and being in the same environment.<br />
Then a screen appeared in the spaceship, saying:<br />
"This was a meeting planned for some days in the future, but it has been done today because we felt like doing it today".<br />
"We, at ThinkOutsideTheBox, want to thank all of you, and we want to say that we are so happy to have you here today".<br />
"Everyone who participated, everyone who live inside a LonelyShip, everyone that live inside a DoubleLonelyShip".<br />
"And some specific people... that live inside a... Group SpaceShip :), everyone is important".<br />
"And to know that we created those things, those spaceships called LonelyShips, to make people happy".<br />
"To make a good thing, the spaceships are lonely, but you're all here now, talking with each other, meeting new people and making friends".<br />
"We are also commemorating here, commemorating... 2 years of the SpaceLiving Network, we are so happy to see all of your faces".<br />
"And we are happy knowing that we made you people happy, and probably not lonely today, we are happy  to give life to your thoughts".<br />
"We are happy and proud to make your wishes a reality, and to provide the possibility of living how you want".<br />
"We are so happy to write, to live and to create things for the people that want then, so, thank you all".<br />
"Everyone who read the story too, Izaque, or stake2 or Funkysnipa Cat, you're a good guy, and a smart guy".<br />
"Thanks for being in our LonelyShip and thanks for being yourself and thanks for existing, xD".<br />
"Thanks for everything, and we will continue to live like this, and the SpaceShips will continue to exist".<br />
"Also... protect yourself from the asteroids, dubstep is good, and be lonely! (well that's a weird thing to say after what happened today)".<br />
The screen disappears, a button to teleport back to your SpaceShip appears, Izaque, Wendy and Lisa keep talking there.<br />
Manuh, Kendra, Drag, Ted, Monika and John teleport back to their spaceships.<br />
"Não demora muito Stake" (Don't take too long Stake), says Manuh.<br />
After some time, Izaque, Wendy and Lisa teleported back to their spaceships, Izaque and Wendy talked a little about the anniversay.<br />
"It was good right?", says Wendy.<br />
"Yea, it was pretty awesome, seeing everyone and stuff", says Izaque.<br />
Izaque was a little tired, he watched an episode of the second season of One Punch Man and laid on his bed.<br />
He slept.<br />
Wendy was practicing on her keyboard, she thought she learned a lot since the last time she played.<br />
Manuh was sleeping already, Kendra was sleeping too, she was dreaming about No Man's Sky, or a Synthwave world.<br />
Drag was listening to some kpop on his smartphone.<br />
Lisa was writing a little, The Odds Of Nature again ("She love to write that story", says the *Writer*).<br />
Ted and Monika were watching a romance movie, they loved to watch it together.<br />
John was finishing the newest chapter of one of his stories [Me too, ah, stop breaking the fourth wall...].<br />
Everyone was happy in the SpaceLiving Network, living their lives, doing their stuff, doing what they love.<br />
It was a good day for SpaceLiving."<br /><br />

Chapter 8<br />
---<br />
It was a beautiful day in the SpaceLiving world.<br />
Lisa, Izaque, Wendy, John, Ted, Monika, Manuh, Kendra, and Drag were all inside their spaceships, living happily.<br />
Izaque was looking for "New World Things" on the Internet and Discord Servers.<br />
He was a SpaceLiver or a resident of the LonelyShips but also liked to do "New World Stuff" in the earth.<br />
Izaque learned about this New World Theory in 2016, it was about a group of people that were changing the whole world.<br />
With holograms, soul-like body forms, beings, laws, he made the documentation of New World and a website for it in 2019, before being teleported to a LonelyShip.<br />
And sometimes, he teleports out of his spaceship, to do those New World stuff, to use holograms, to see his loved characters of his favorite cartoon.<br />
Which is My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic, Izaque dreamed his entire life about being able to see them, to hug them, to talk to them.<br />
The first time he saw them, with the possibility that New World has created for him, was two months before he was teleported to his LonelyShip, he hugged every one of them.<br />
Twilight Sparkle, Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, Rarity, and Applejack.<br />
He was so happy at that moment, he could cry of happiness all day.<br />
New World and the New World Government have created a portal to all the visual things that humans have created, movies, cartoons, anime, games, series.<br />
Izaque loved to visit and talk with all his favorite characters, of MLP, Sword Art Online, Fairy Tail, To Love Ru, Shingeki No Kyojin, Yuru Camp, Plastic Memories, Eromanga Sensei.<br />
He had a lot of New World friends, who knew about New World its technology.<br />
Izaque was tired, he said for some Discord friends that he was going to take a nap, he looked at the computer clock and perceived that it was 12:00 in the afternoon.<br />
He said good afternoon to Wendy, Lulu, Igor, Carol, Paulo, Camila, and Natalia, then he turned off the computer and laid on his bed.<br />
Izaque was dreaming, he was a kid in that dream, a kid named Izaque, and he was eating dinner with Lulu, his sister, Ana, his mother, John, his father.<br />
He loved his family, Izaque loved to go out on adventures with Lulu and John, in one specific adventure, Izaque got a Gold Glove with jewels in it, he thinks the last user of this glove was sonahT.<br />
Izaque loved to use his glove, to protect his family, the glove had the power to create portals, to travel to another dimension, and to fire elements.<br />
One night, everyone except Izaque was sleeping, he grabbed his glove and got out of the house, then opened a portal to the My Little Pony World.<br />
It was his first time in another world, he transformed his glove into two normal, black gloves, and made himself invisible.<br />
He looked and analyzed the creatures of that world, they were ponies, then Izaque imagined himself like a pony, he transformed into one with a green mane, blue skin and became visible.<br />
A pink pony approached him, he was scared, because he didn't want to draw too much attention or make a commotion.<br />
The pink pony said in a sharp, shrill voice: "I've never seen you here in Ponyville, are you new?, <br />
my name is Pinkie Pie and I am the receptionist, party planner, and cupcakes cooker of town, what's your name?."<br />
Izaque was scared and surprised about how that pony could talk so fast, it was hard for him to understand all those words in so little time.<br />
He replied: "Uh... my name is Izaque and yes, I'm new here, I don't want to live here, you know... I'm just a visitor, can I talk to...".<br />
At that moment, Izaque moved his right hoof to his back and used the hidden glove to know a little about the universe.<br />
It looked like he was stealing or copying the knowledge that the Izaque of Planet Earth in 2019 had about the My Little Pony universe.<br />
"Twilight Sparkle?", said him, finishing his sentence.<br />
Pinkie Pie said: "Oh, you wanna meet my friend Twilight right?, I'll take you to her".<br />
"Thanks a lot!", replied Izaque.<br />
They both walked to the Friendship Castle and Pinkie Pie knocked on the door.<br />
Twilight opened the door and said: "Oh hey Pinkie Pie", then turned her head to Izaque and said while getting close to his face:<br />
"Hey... I think I know you, you have an aura of someone I know... can I look at you more closely?".<br />
Izaque blushed and said: "W-well, maybe, hehe...".<br />
Pinkie Pie said: "Well... I'm gonna leave you guys alone", and started walking away from them.<br />
"Good!", said Twilight.<br />
Then she began to mumble while analyzing him, "You remind me of Izaque... a human that comes here sometimes", said her.<br />
"I fear you're a version of him from another universe, what are you doing here, and why are you a pony? how did you get here?".<br />
Izaque said: "Well... I just wanted to visit this world, I'm a pony because I have a magician item, I got here by that same magician item".<br />
Then he thought to himself: "Man, I have to go back, I learned through the Izaque of 2019 that one day in this world is one year at my world, I hope that's a myth".<br />
Twilight said: "Oh... and what magician item is that?".<br />
"Can I go in? I can't show that in public", whispered Izaque.<br />
Twilight said: "Sure!, come in", Izaque walked in and Twilight closed the door.<br />
"It's this thing here", said Izaque, while transforming his glove back to its original state.<br />
Twilight's eyes shined when she saw the beautiful, sheeny gold glove with jewels, she wanted to touch it.<br />
She moved her hoof close to the glove, Izaque moved the glove closer to him and said: "I gotta go Twilight, sorry, I'm gonna leave this... stone here, so you can remember that I'm gonna come back".<br />
"Oh, okay...", said Twilight, then Izaque created a small rock with the letter "I" on it and dropped it on the floor, opened a portal back to his world and crossed through it.<br />
He was back at his world, he came inside the house and walked to his room, stored his glove on a wooden chest and slept again.<br />
Before sleeping, Izaque thought: "I said I was going to travel to other worlds, Lulu of Planet Earth!".<br />
Then the dream of Izaque changed to something else, he was dreaming about a game called No Man's Sky.<br />
Wendy was in her spaceship, she perceived that she loved the bird Phoenix, and wanted to have one, she asked herself if she could create one in the spaceship.<br />
Then a voice started speaking in the spaceship, it said: "Do you want to have a pet in your spaceship?, then click on this button and the Pets menu will open on your computer".<br />
"If you had a pet in the earth, it would be brought together with you, but it seems that you don't have one, so get one at the menu".<br />
Wendy pressed the button and the menu opened in the SpaceLiving app that was installed in her computer, she then selected the Phoenix.<br />
The menu lets her choose only the name of the pet, she chose one and clicked on the "Spawn" button.<br />
A Phoenix appeared in her spaceship, the animal was a female, her name was "Philomena".<br />
The bird was an ugly bird, Wendy didn't like that, but then, the bird exploded in flames and became ashes.<br />
After some time, the ashes shine and a beautiful, yellow and red bird is born, shining more than the sun, Wendy got amazed by that.<br />
Philomena flew to Wendy's arm and she smiled, "I love you... Philomena...", said Wendy.<br />
Then after some time, an open birdcage and a nest appeared on the wall, it had bird food and water, a voice on the spaceship said:<br />
"The spaceship automatically detects if the pet needs food or water, if the pet drinks or eats all the food, the space ship will put more in there".<br />
"And the spaceship has a special place for each type of animal, so they can do their necessities, every time the pet thinks about doing that, the spaceship will release a scent".<br />
"A scent that makes the pet want to go to that special place, your pet will be in good hands, or more like... mechanical arms and pistons, thanks for getting a pet, take care of it!".<br />
Wendy was a little tired, she played some piano, Philomena danced to the music that she was playing, Wendy was happy about that.<br />
She got tired and laid on her bed, slept and had a good dream, a happy dream, where she was with her friends and had Philomena with her.<br />
Izaque was still dreaming about No Man's Sky, he was talking with a friend of him, a Korvax.<br />
John was writing one of his stories on his computer, he wanted to finish that chapter quickly because he was sleepy and tired.<br />
He finished the chapter and sent it to Lisa, she liked the chapter and told him to post it, he posted and received a lot of comments.<br />
John was too tired to reply to them all, he ate two chocolate crackers and drank a cup of water, then laid on his bed and slept.<br />
Every one at SpaceLiving was sleeping, it was 23:00 there, Ted was sleeping together with Monika.<br />
They always sleep hugged, Ted was dreaming about being the character of the survival game Don't Starve, the character was Wilson.<br />
He walked a little at the grassland, and gathered some grass and sticks, then made a campfire with rocks.<br />
After that, he took some trees down and put five logs into the campfire, cooked a pork-chop and ate it.<br />
Then he walked a little far to check some traps that he had made to catch some rabbits, three of them had rabbits trapped inside them.<br />
John picked up the traps and killed all the bunnies, then walked back to his campfire and cooked the three rabbits and stored them in his fridge.<br />
Monika was dreaming of being a computer file, she was inside a game, in that game, there were five characters, her, Sayori, Yuri, Natsuki, and Izaque, or the main character.<br />
She thought that the dream was really weird, it seemed too real, she knew that it was a game.<br />
A video was becoming famous at the Internet, it was a video that Izaque posted, he recorded his LonelyShip and made a tour through it.<br />
He showed his powerful computer, his ThoughtPoweredFridge(TPF), how it worked, how the buttons of the spaceship worked, what the windows showed.<br />
Izaque said it was a beautiful spaceship, with white walls, he said he loved to live there with Manuh, Drag, and Kendra.<br />
Lisa was listening to some synth-pop songs she had downloaded, she wanted to talk a little with Izaque.<br />
Izaque woke up, he needed some coffee, he got out of bed and opened the fridge, his beautiful, quadrangular, green cup was there, with some coffee with milk.<br />
It was hot, and the smell was amazing, the color, 20% milk, and 80% coffee, the milk was poured first, just like he liked.<br />
He surely loved that cup, it was his favorite cup at the earth, then he turned on his computer and played whatever he was listening to the last time he used the computer.<br />
It was a rock song, the volume was so high that he spilled coffee on the table and on the floor, "Shit!", shouted him.<br />
He paused the song quickly, left the cup on the table and picked up a napkin to wipe the table, then cleaned the table and changed his clothes.<br />
Izaque listened to a calm song while drinking his coffee and checking his social media, the name of the song was "<a href="https://soundcloud.com/officialpandaeyes/panda-eyes-take-my-hand-ft-azuria-sky-zne-remix">Panda Eyes - Take My Hand Ft. Azuria Sky (Z∆NE Remix)</a>".<br />
Some people liked and commented on his stories in Wattpad, he replied to all of them, thanking his fans, then replied to his messages on Facebook and Discord.<br />
He loved to know that Wendy, Lulu, Paulo, and Igor had talked to him, he was so happy to see them every day, even if it wasn't physically.<br />
For him, was awesome to see their faces, or profile pictures every day.<br />
Kendra woke up and wanted to eat something sweet, she got up and grabbed a marshmallow that was inside the fridge.<br />
She ate it and loved it, then she wanted to listen to some rock on her computer, she put it to play.<br />
Kendra was just like Izaque, headbanging to rock just like he headbangs to Dubstep.<br />
Manuh and Drag were still sleeping, they were dreaming about a lot of things, Drag dreamed about visiting some k-pop artists.<br />
Then about playing a game in his smartphone, Free Fire, he liked to play that game.<br />
Manuh dreamed about living with Brendon Urie from the band Panic! at the Disco, she loved him.<br />
Wendy was dreaming about playing the piano, she thought about a good video that she saw one day, about a cover of Bad Guy from Billie Eilish.<br />
She liked that video, and sent it to a special friend of her, her friend like the video and thanked her.<br />
Monika was dreaming about living in the No Man's Sky world, those SpaceLivers(LonelyShippers) surely dream right? (informal: man they don't stop dreaming xDD)<br /><br />

Chapter 9 - PequeLiving, SpaceNata?<br />
---<br />
(This story is the second part of this one: <a href="https://diario.netlify.com/pequenata/26">https://diario.netlify.com/pequenata/26</a> )<br />
"Lisa was sitting in her chair while looking at the computer screen, a notification got her attention.<br />
Someone asked to add her as a friend in Discord, it was someone called Littletato, she looked cute in the picture, Lisa accepted her friend request.<br />
They began to chat:<br />
Lisa: "Hello... do you added me from the SpaceLiving server right?".<br />
Littletato: "Yea... I've met some cool people there, and I thought you looked cool and gentle xD, I'm annoying you in some way?".<br />
Lisa: "Of course not!, I love to talk to new people ^^, you're a SpaceLiver right?, or a LonelyShipper".<br />
Littletato: "Yes, I guess I could be called that way xD, I was just scrolling Facebook at my computer and began floating and a light blue light surrounded my body, I didn't know what was happening, I was very scared...".<br />
Lisa: "Oh... that is one of the rumors that I been hearing, I think it was called Random-Teleport, it isn't the standard procedure for teleporting someone to a SpaceShip, I feel sorry for you...".<br />
Littletato: "Hm, thanks for explaining that to me, I already ate a slice of pizza an watched an anime called Eromanga Sensei, that is enough to be considered a SpaceLiver? xD".<br />
Lisa: "Maybe xD, actually, to be considered a SpaceLiver you have to be teleported to a SpaceLiving ship, there are a lot of cool things to do".<br />
Lisa: "Also... Eromanga Sensei?, I love that anime!, in fact, I look a little like the main character, Sagiri, here... I'll send a pic of me...".<br />
<a href="img/lisa.jpg"><img src="img/lisa.jpg" width="10%" style="float:left;border-width:4px;border-color:#2196F3;border-style:solid;" /></a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
Littletato: "Oh... you're cute xD, and you look like her! :3, I'll send a photo of me... don't look too much, I'm shy... :3".<br />
(Narrator-Izaque: Julia will get mad Littletato... don't send pics to her xD)<br />
<a href="img/pequenata.jpg"><img src="img/pequenata.jpg" width="10%" style="float:left;border-width:4px;border-color:#2196F3;border-style:solid;" /></a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
Lisa: "Y-You're cute too! :3, hehe, I like your hair, I wanted to have that color, also... it is raining where your SpaceShip is located?, I've never seen a cloud near my spaceship before, this is weird...".<br />
Littletato: "Really? there are no clouds in here, how clouds can exist here if we are living in space xD".<br />
Lisa: "I don't know xD, hey, do you wanna meet some of my friends?".<br />
Littletato: "Um... sure, if they're as cool as you xD".<br />
Lisa: "Well, here's the discord tag of my friend Izaque, he is very cool, also, do you wanna read my stories?, Izaque writes too xD".<br />
Littletato: "I'm gonna add him, send me the link or file you would like me to read, I would love to read something made by you".<br />
Then Littletato asked for the friend request of Izaque and opened the story page of "The Odds of Nature", the story that Lisa had sent to her.<br />
Littletato began chatting with Izaque:<br />
Littletato: "Hello Izaque... Lisa sent me your discord tag so I added you on here, thanks for accepting the friend request, so... do you write stories? UwU".<br />
Izaque: "Well, I'm writing you right now... I-I mean, I'm writing something right now, but you can talk with me :3, I think Lisa didn't tell me that you were going to add me".<br />
Littletato: "Maybe you gotta talk with her about that, also, what you're writing?, I was watching Eromanga Sensei, I told that to Lisa and she told me that she looks like the main character, Sagiri".<br />
Littletato: "She sent me a pic of her... she's very cute, but you already know that right? you guys look to be very close friends...".<br />
Izaque: "Yea, well, actually, she never sent me a pic of her '-'... I'm gonna ask for her to send me a pic xD".<br />
Littletato: "That is weird xD... but probably she would send one to you, I-I...".<br />
Izaque: "What?, I'm not gonna judge you... don't need to worry".<br />
Littletato: "It's not that... I mean, I was teleported here by mistake, I was just minding my own business at my computer and I began floating and a light blue light surrounded me, then I was taken to this spaceship".<br />
Izaque: "So the rumors were true... the Random-Teleport, well, they said that you can go back, right? at least that's what the rumor says...".<br />
Littletato: "Yea, they said that I could right-click the tray icon and select [Teleport back to Earth], maybe it's a glitch or something, and the system called the wrong person?".<br />
Izaque: "Yea, I guess it's that, have you tried clicking that button? probably they will ask for a confirmation, don't worry".<br />
After that, Littletato right-clicked the tray icon and selected [Teleport back to Earth], a message prompted her confirmation saying "Do you really want to teleport back to Earth?".<br />
Littletato came back to the Discord window and sent a message to Izaque saying:<br />
"Yea... you're right, looks like it works, and it asked me for a confirmation...".<br />
Izaque: "Oh, that's cool, I hope you can get back on earth if you really want to, can I send you one of my stories?".<br />
Littletato: "Yes!, I would love to read something made by you ❤️...".<br />
Izaque: "Okay, I'll send it, I'll also add you to the Readers list :3".<br />
Then Izaque sent Littletato a link to his story, Clone Network.<br />
Littletato: "I'm so happy to be on that list! :3".<br />
Izaque: "Thanks for the love and support Littletato, I'm really happy I met you :3 ❤️".<br />
Littletato: "I think I'm gonna finish reading one chapter of The Odds Of Nature and Clone Network, thanks for sending me the link".<br />
Izaque: "Oh, the story of Lisa xD, she has a lot of talent for writing".<br />
Littletato: "I agree with you, makes me feel inside the story".<br />
Izaque: "I feel the same way xD, I think I'm gonna watch something from my To Watch list, Littletato, can I ask you something?".<br />
Littletato: "Yes?...".<br />
Izaque: "C-Can you send me a picture of you?...".<br />
Izaque: "Sorry, I shouldn't have asked that...".<br />
Littletato: "Okay, here it is, it's the same I sent to Lisa".<br />
<a href="img/pequenata.jpg"><img src="img/pequenata.jpg" width="10%" style="float:left;border-width:4px;border-color:#2196F3;border-style:solid;" /></a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
Izaque: "Really?... you're really cute! :3... hehe, you have beautiful eyes...".<br />
Littletato: "Thanks Izaque! :3 ^w^, can you send me one of you too?, I am shy and embarrassed now...".<br />
Izaque: "Oh, sorry, I forgot!".<br />
(Well, guess I can't put that pic here xD, reader, I'm shy, sorry, please ask for my Discord tag on my Twitter profile that you can find on <a href="https://diario.netlify.com/pages/me/">this link</a> if you really wanna see my face)<br />
Littletato: "You're so cuuuute! :3, I'm blushing so much right now, sorry".<br />
Izaque: "It's ok xD, thanks, you're also cute Pequenata, I mean, Littletato".<br />
Littletato: "How do you know that name?, some people call me Pequenata here in San Francisco, actually, *there* in San Francisco, I don't know why maybe it's the Brazilian version of the name...".<br />
Izaque: "I didn't know that, I mean, ah... I can't explain this... sorry".<br />
Littletato: "It's okay... I'm gonna read something, okay?, sorry if I don't reply too quickly :3".<br />
Izaque: "Okay :3, I'm a little busy here too xD".<br />
Littletato then began to read The Odds Of Nature, she read the story until the fifth chapter and stopped.<br />
After that, she read Clone Network and liked, she wanted to say that to Izaque and Lisa.<br />
Littletato opened her conversation with Izaque and said:<br />
"Hello... I loved your story Izaque!, I liked how you were making a lot of clones to make everything you want, that's a really good thought and an awesome idea xD".<br />
Izaque: "Oh, thanks for the feedback Littletato :3, I'm glad you loved it because I sure loved to write that story...".<br />
Izaque: "Also, can you promise me something Tato?".<br />
Littletato: "Tato, I liked that name xD, what is it?".<br />
Izaque: "Can you promise me that you will tell me when you begin to teleport back to earth?".<br />
Littletato: "Yes... I'll make sure to tell you, I promise :3".<br />
Izaque: "Thanks...".<br />
Littletato: "You're welcome my dear friend".<br />
Then Izaque opened his conversation with Lisa to ask something:<br />
"Hey, Lisa...".<br />
Lisa: "Hello Izaque!, how are you? :3".<br />
Izaque: "Well, I'm good, did you sent my discord tag to Littletato without asking me?".<br />
Lisa: "Uh... yea... sorry Izaque, I'm gonna ask for your permission the next time, sorry...".<br />
Izaque: "It's okay, I'm not mad at you :3, but... Littletato said you sent a pic to her, and you never sent a pic to me '-'...".<br />
Lisa: "Aww my sweetie... I didn't send it because you didn't ask... here, I'll send one to you, and... you never sent me one pic too xD".<br />
Izaque: "Sorry, I'll send xD".<br />
<a href="img/lisa.jpg"><img src="img/lisa.jpg" width="10%" style="float:left;border-width:4px;border-color:#2196F3;border-style:solid;" /></a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
(again, can't show my face here xD)<br />
Izaque: "You're so cuuuuute Lisa! :3, I love your green eyes and your cute grey hair :3".<br />
Lisa: "You're so cute tooo my love! :3, I love your fluffy hair and cute face, your nose is cute too :3 xD".<br />
Izaque: "Thanks Lisa xD, I'm blushing right now, thanks for so much love ❤️".<br />
Lisa: "You're welcome my love! ❤️".<br />
...<br />
Littletato was worried about Julia, she opened the menu to teleport back to Earth when she was ready to click on the button labeled "Yes!", she thought about Izaque and Lisa, her two dear friends.<br />
She thought about telling them goodbye.<br />
(Play this song and read this part while listening to it: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/officialpandaeyes/oppositeside">https://soundcloud.com/officialpandaeyes/oppositeside</a> )<br />
Littletato opened the chat of Izaque and said.<br />
"Hello Izaque, I'm going back to earth now, it was good and fun to meet you, I was happy, maybe we'll see each other again soon... I hope you have a good day, or... night xD :3".<br />
Izaque: "It was fun to meet and talk with you too Littletato, I'll definitely write about you more, I mean, we'll definitely see each other again, maybe in chapter 50 of Pequenata, I mean, maybe soon! :3".<br />
Izaque: "Goodbye Littletato! :3".<br />
Littletato: "Goodbye Izaque! :3 :)".<br />
Then she talked to Lisa:<br />
"Hello Lisa, I'm going back to earth!, I hope we see each other again soon, I was happy while talking with you even if it was just for one day, thank you for that Lisa!".<br />
Lisa: "Oh, you're going now :), goodbye Littletato, I'm sure we'll see each other again, I was happy with you too! :3, thank you! :33".<br />
Littletato: "Tee hee! thanks, Lisa, goodbye :3"."<br /><br />

Chapter 10 - Marina joins the chat<br />
---<br />
Wendy was playing some keyboard on her spaceship, it was the theme song of the Titanic movie, she liked to practice keyboard.<br />
Izaque was thinking about his days at school, he had a lot of friends there and liked talking to them every day, the food was not very good but he liked.<br />
Monika was talking to some of her friends on Discord, one friend of hers was called Sayori.<br />
Monika said: "hey Sayori, how are you?..."<br />
Sayori: "hey Monika, I'm fine, how about you?"<br />
Monika: "I'm good too, just living here in the spaceship with my boyfriend Ted"<br />
Sayori: "Oh, I got a part-time job with Yuri, it is on a library"<br />
Monika: "That sounds very sweet Sayori, good luck on your job! What about Yuri?"<br />
Sayori: "Well... she liked the job because she loves books, so I guess its a really good job for her"<br />
Ted was playing some Titanfall 2 with his friends, after that he changed to Terraria.<br />
Izaque got a notification on the Discord server of SpaceLiving saying that a new SpaceLiver has arrived.<br />
The message says: "@Funkysnipa Cat#XXXX Hello, a new SpaceLiver has arrived!, it would be good if you could greet them and explain to them about the SpaceLiving Network, thanks for your help! :)"<br />
Izaque then added the new SpaceLiver on Discord, she was called Marina.<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Hello, I'm an admin at the SpaceLiving Discord server, they told me that you're new here, so... need help with anything? :)"<br />
Her user-name was Peach_Army, she said: "I wanted to know where I am, where all of this came from and who's the owner of this rabbit?"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat said: "Well... this spaceship is called "LonelyShip", she is hovering some kilometers away from earth, if you look through the window you will see the earth."<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "This bunny was given to you because you had thought before coming here about having a bunny, and then the spaceship gave it to you."<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Don't worry, if you want to go back home you can click on the icon on your computer and click on "Teleport back to earth..."<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "The spaceship teleported you because it felt your desire, about living alone, only with a computer, food, a bathroom, this happened with me too, and with everyone at the server."<br />
Marina looked at the window and thought about the earth for a little, about everything she went through there, then she decides something and walks to the computer and types on the shiny keys.<br />
Peach_Army: "I want to stay."<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Hm, I'm happy for you, I can assure you will be so much happy here, I hope I have helped you, we can be friends?... my name is Izaque."<br />
Peach_Army: "Well, if I'm gonna stay alone here with... the bunny, then yes, we can be friends."<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Oh that's good, I'm glad, what's your name?"<br />
Peach_Army: "My name is Marina, nice to meet you."<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Nice to meet you too Marina."<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "So... what do you like to do on the computer? :D"<br />
Marina: "I try to compose songs, play some games of strategy and talk a little"<br />
Marina: "I also see doramas"<br />
Marina: "and study"<br />
Marina: "How about you?"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Well, I watch anime, write some stories, talk with some friends here on Discord, help the new people who arrive, I love to play too, on Xbox One, PS4"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "And studying was one of the boring things that I did in my life on earth xD, why do you study? or what you study?"<br />
Marina: "Actually, studying was one of the things I loved the most on Earth"<br />
Marina: "I like to know that what I learn will always innovate"<br />
Marina: "I must have been one of the only people who like math"<br />
Marina: "xD"<br />
Marina: "And I study Asian culture"<br />
Marina: "Mostly the Korean"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "lol, I think I can drop the "first capital letter" and use period, they say I can't be friends with the people I help get to SpaceLiving"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "I think I didn't like to learn what I wouldn't use like history, Brazilian Portuguese, or the things of the school, but I love to learn about technology"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "I love Japanese culture"<br />
Marina: "One of my favorites too lol"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "hahaha"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "I love to show this New World to people, because I love to live in it, the SpaceLiving, but I don't like the rules, like the one I told you about"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "do you know the name of the company that created the SpaceLiving Network?"<br />
Marina: "no.."<br />
Marina: "Which one?"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Its ThinkOutsideTheBox or TOTB"<br />
Marina: "How the families of the people of SpaceLiving feel like?"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "I think they get sad, but some don't care, because they don't care about the relative, they receive a message like a hologram, telling that their relative of them is on a SpaceLiving"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "you can eat what you want on the fridge, but your relatives can send special food for you if they want, just let them know"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "like food from your grandma or mom that you love"<br />
Marina: "I see..."<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "there's also a teleporter on the spaceship that can teleport you to a house that you consider trustworthy like your parents' house to visit if you miss them"<br />
Marina: "I was going to ask that now xD"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "xD"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "just go there and think "my dad's house" "my mom's house" or something, and click a button called "Submit" "<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "the person who lives in the house of your choice will receive the notification and will choose to accept or not, then a teleporter will be created in the chosen house"<br />
Marina: "Got it..."<br />
Marina: "I think I'll like it here"<br />
Marina: "It seems my dream has finally come true, without the problems of others surrounding me"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "That's very good Marina, this was my dream too, and living alone too, I love computers"<br />
Marina: "My computer gave life to me xD"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "xD"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "I think there's a boy who writes stories about this spaceship"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Or his spaceship in this case, maybe this boy is me xD, just maybe..."<br />
Marina: "Really?!"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "yes Hahaha xD"<br />
Marina: "I'd love to read your story someday"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "I'd love to send it to you"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "there are already some chapters published"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "want the link?"<br />
Marina: "Yes, Please"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "<a href="https://diario.netlify.com/new_world/spaceliving/">https://diario.netlify.com/new_world/spaceliving/</a>"<br />
Marina: "Thank you"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "you're welcome, thanks for reading"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "I think in chapter 5 there's an invite to the SpaceLiving server, but that's kind of useless since you're already on it"<br />
Marina: "So, who reads till Chapter 5, and is on Earth, can go to SpaceLiving?!"<br />
Marina: "If I had known I would have read your story before xDDD"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "xDD"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Well... no, I just send this story to someone that is already on a ship"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "But I think there are some internet tutorials on how to be "invited" to live on a SpaceLiving"<br />
Marina: "I've never seen anything about it"<br />
Marina: "I would have liked it a lot"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Me too"<br />
Marina: "I'll talk to you later, I'm gonna watch an anime here, see ya later :3"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "See you later Marina :3"<br />
Then Marina walked close to her TPF(Thought-Powered-Fridge) and thought about a coca-cola and a slice of pizza.<br />
She sat at her chair and laid the cup and plate on the top of the table, then downloaded an episode of the anime called Eromanga Sensei to watch.<br />
Marina ate the food and drank the soda while watching, she loved to watch anime while eating.<br />
After that, she was feeling a little tired, she said goodnight to Izaque and laid on her bed, then slept.<br /><br />
<hr class="slhr" />

<br />
<h5 class="w3-text-blue"><hr class="slhr" />
Chapter 11 - The visit of Izaque<br />
---<br />
Izaque was in his LonelyShip, he was listening to a song of the Dubstep genre on Foobar2000, he thought about Marina, his special friend.<br />
He wanted to visit her somehow, or teleport to her LonelyShip, he messaged her on Discord, saying:<br />
"Hey Marina, can I teleport to your SpaceShip?... I wanted to visit you".<br />
She replied positively, then he opened the SpaceLiving Dashboard on his computer.<br />
A button popped up, it said:<br />
"Teleport to...".<br />
Then he clicked and typed the id of Marina's Discord alongside with her name.<br />
A message appeared on Marina's computer, saying:<br />
"Funkysnipa Cat#XXXX wants to teleport to your LonelyShip, accept?".<br />
She clicked on yes, then the teleporter of Izaque began to shine blue, he walked inside it and closed the door.<br />
A blue light shines inside Marina's teleporter after it disappears Marina sees Izaque inside the teleporter.<br />
He gets out of it and says:<br />
"Hi Marina!", says Izaque.<br />
"Hi!", says Marina.<br />
"So... I guess it's been a while since I've seen a person... personally," says Izaque with a short laugh.<br />
"Yes," says Marina with a short laugh.<br />
"Can I sit on your bed?", asks Izaque.<br />
"Yes you can," she says, tapping the bed beside him, indicating that he should sit there.<br />
He sits on her bed and realizes that the coverlet of the bed is purple and is very beautiful, he starts looking at Marina's spaceship.<br />
She continues to fiddle with her laptop.<br />
He looks at Marina fidgeting with her laptop and has an idea.<br />
"Hey Marina, would you like to watch something with me? Like an anime? The spaceship has a computer too if you want, and a big screen," asks Izaque.<br />
"Okay... We can eat something while we watch," says Marina, who gets up and goes to the fridge, choosing some sweets.<br />
"Ok, thanks," says Izaque.<br />
"Can I go choosing the movie?" Asks Izaque.<br />
"Sure," answers Marina.<br />
"Okay," says Izaque.<br />
He grabs Marina's notebook, opens the SpaceLiving interface, activates the computer and large monitor, and uses the remote controller to pick a movie on the computer.<br />
It opens the SpaceFlix application on the computer, which has all sorts of things mankind has ever produced, anime, movies, series, doramas, videos.<br />
"What do you want to eat?" Asks Marina.<br />
"Hm... pizza, but without onion, and a coke," he says as he picks a specific Japanese dorama he knows Marina likes, called Meteor Garden.<br />
He selects the first episode and pauses waiting for Marina to get the food.<br />
She takes what he asks and for her, gets ice cream and some cookies.<br />
"I'm coming!" Says Marina.<br />
"Okay," he says smiling at Marina.<br />
She puts his pizza on a plate and takes it along with the Coke, "Here," she says smiling.<br />
"Thanks, Marina," he says, who then picks up his pizza and coke and settles into bed.<br />
She sits next to him and says:<br />
"What are you putting for us to watch?"<br />
"Meteor Garden, I think you like this drama, right?" He asks.<br />
"I love! Thank you!" she says, who smiles at him and looks at the screen.<br />
"You're welcome Marina," he smiles back at her, gets up, and picks up the computer's wireless mouse and keyboard.<br />
Izaque leaves the video in full screen and presses play, then sits back in bed to watch with Marina.<br />
Marina paid attention to every detail of the scenes while eating ice cream.<br />
He stared at the screen as he ate his piece of pizza and drank his coke.<br />
"Are you enjoying it?" She whispered now turning her attention to Izaque.<br />
"Yes, this drama is very cool, you have good taste Marina," he replies.<br />
"Thank you." She feels a slight flush on her cheeks and turns her attention to the screen.<br />
"You're welcome," Izaque smiles at Marina and turns her attention back to the screen.<br />
He thinks how cool it is to be able to live on a SpaceLiving spaceship and watch movies in high resolutions while eating delicious stuff, and he feels like it's been a long time since he had a physical connection with anyone.<br />
Izaque finishes his pizza and his coke, the episode is already halfway through.<br />
She eats some cookies, "Want?" She says offering him one.<br />
"Yes," he replies, taking a cookie and eating it.<br />
"It's nice to watch along with you Marina, I'm so happy," he says, smiling at her.<br />
"I enjoyed your company here Zaq!" She smiles back.<br />
"Thanks, I also enjoyed keeping you company," he replies.<br />
It was the end of the episode, Izaque's coke can was on his plate, and Marina's ice cream jar was on the floor.<br />
Izaque left Marina's computer screen on the desktop and stood up, taking his plate and her jar.<br />
"Thank you," she says.<br />
"You're welcome, hey Marina, I don't know if you know, but if you put your used cutlery, utensils and plates in the fridge, it'll get rid of them," he says, opening the fridge and placing the plate and jar inside as he explains.<br />
After that he opens the fridge and looks at Marina, she sees that the fridge is empty.<br />
"I didn't know, thanks for telling me," she says, who gives a short laugh.<br />
"So, I think I'll come back to my Marina spaceship, hey..." he says thoughtfully.<br />
"Go on," she says as she watches him closely.<br />
"Can I give you a hug before I go?" Asks Izaque.<br />
She smiles and gets up, approaching him and saying "Yes you can".<br />
Izaque hugs her and closes her eyes, enjoying the moment.<br />
"Thanks for keeping me company today, I wanted to see someone," she says as she hugs him tighter and then releases him, waving and saying, "See you."<br />
"You're welcome, see ya," says Izaque, who enters the teleporter, as he was a guest on Marina's spaceship, he can only teleport back to his spaceship.<br />
He closes the teleporter's door and pushes a blue button that says "Back to your spaceship." After a few seconds a blue light comes on inside the teleporter, he takes one last look at Marina and then disappears.<br />
Marina smiles at him before he disappears, and is pleased to see Izaque.<br />
Izaque goes back to his teleporter, opens the door and gets out of it, turns on his computer and opens Discord to talk to Marina.<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Hey Marina... thanks for today, it was really cool, I think I'll get some sleep".<br />
Marina: "Yes, I really enjoyed today. Goodnight Izaque."<br />
Then Izaque turns off his computer, lies in his bed and sleeps.<br /><br />

Capitulo 1<br />
---<br />
"No ano de 2019 tinha uma lenda de uma nave que tinha uma casa inteira dentro dela.<br />
Essa nave tinha uma geladeira e um banheiro com um vaso sanitário a laser que derretia tudo dentro dele.<br />
E pessoas que conseguiam essas naves eram pessoas que gostavam de ficar nos seus quartos.<br />
Sozinhos e fazendo coisas como usar o computador e jogar vídeo-games.<br />
Muitas dessas pessoas que tinham naves eram adolescentes, eles eram sozinhos e depressivos.<br />
Por alguma razão eles eram tele-transportados para essas naves.<br />
Uma dessas pessoas era Lisa, uma garota de 16 anos.<br />
Ela jogava jogos, usava a geladeira para comer, escrevia histórias no computador.<br />
Ela vivia lá, vivia a vida dela lá fazendo as coisas que ela amava.<br />
Ela acordou, Lisa tinha um quarto lindo na nave dela.<br />
Um quarto com a cor rosa, um computador, um Playstation 4, uma geladeira, um banheiro com um vaso sanitário laser.<br />
Uma cama e um Nintendo 3DS.<br />
Ela amava ficar lá, escrever histórias, jogar jogos e ouvir musicas japonesas e dubstep no computador dela.<br />
Hoje ela não tinha nada pra fazer, mas ela queria jogar alguns jogos.<br />
Ela ligou o computador dela e sentou na cadeira, então ela abriu a Steam e esperou ela abrir.<br />
Ela abriu Titanfall 2 pra jogar um pouco.<br />
Ela amava aquele jogo, ela entrou em uma partida multi-player.<br />
Ela fez um 10/3, ela gostou daquela partida.<br />
Então ela fechou a Steam e abriu o Firefox e o Spotify.<br />
Ela escolheu uma musica de Dubstep pra tocar nos alto-falantes dela.<br />
Então ela abriu o Facebook para falar com os amigos dela.<br />
Ela falou com a amiga dela chamada Anny.<br />
"Como você está Anny?", disse Lisa.<br />
"Eu to bem, e tu?", disse Anny.<br />
"Eu to de boa também, o que tu ta fazendo agora?", disse Lisa.<br />
"Jogando God of War no meu PS4", disse Anny.<br />
"Ah, isso é legal, eu vou fazer outra coisa agora", disse Lisa.<br />
"Blz", disse Anny.<br />
Então Lisa ligou o PS4 dela e pegou o controle.<br />
Ela também abriu o tocador de musica no computador dela que se chamava Foobar e fechou o Spotify.<br />
Ela tinha muitos GBs de musica, ela gostava de ter uma biblioteca grande.<br />
Então Lisa abriu GTA V e começou a jogar, ela jogou o modo online.<br />
Ela estava jogando com seus amigos, e ela estava escutando a musica "Geoxor - Turn Around" no tocador de musica dela.<br />
Ela gostava daquela musica, Lisa tinha dois monitores, um para o computador e um para o PS4.<br />
Lisa percebeu que ela estava com fome, ela ficou afk no jogo e colocou o controle dela na mesa.<br />
Ela se levantou e abriu a geladeira, era uma geladeira automática que trazia tudo que a pessoa quisesse.<br />
Você poderia pensar em uma pizza e uma pizza iria aparecer dentro da geladeira.<br />
Então Lisa pegou o copo de leite achocolatado que estava na geladeira.<br />
E também o hamburger, ela sentou em sua mesa.<br />
Lisa também gostava de assistir filmes.<br />
E séries, animes, desenhos.<br />
Ela baixa essas coisas com o Utorrent.<br />
Depois de um tempo jogando ela disse para os amigos dela que ela iria fazer outra coisa.<br />
Ela gostava da Marvel e os seus filmes, ela baixou "Os Vingadores: Guerra Infinita".<br />
Ela pegou um pote de Doritos e uma garrafa de Coca-cola para assistir o filme.<br />
Ela abriu o tocador de vídeo que tinha o nome de VLC Media Player.<br />
Lisa abriu o arquivo mkv de Guerra Infinita no tocador de vídeo.<br />
Então ela assistiu o filme, ela amou o filme, toda a ação e tudo mais, os heróis.<br />
Então depois de um tempo ela ficou cansada e desligou o computador e PS4 dela.<br />
O corpo dela estava cansado, ela deitou na cama dela e dormiu, ela teve um sonho.<br />
Onde ela estava indo para escola, e também tinha que limpar o quarto dela e a casa dos pais dela.<br />
Lisa também tinha que trabalhar, para ela aquele sonho era um pesadelo.<br />
Então depois de um tempo aquele sonho desapareceu e outro sonho tomou seu lugar, um sonho melhor.<br />
Ela estava sonhando em estar no computador dela ouvindo musicas de dubstep e conversando com os amigos dela no Discord.<br />
Ela gostou daquele sonho, e queria acordar só pra usar o Discord e conversar com os amigos dela.<br />
Lisa gostava do que ela tinha, aquela nave, a cama, computador, PS4 e Nintendo 3DS.<br />
Ela gostava de jogar, assistir, escrever e conversar.<br />
Ela queria ficar sozinha, e queria ter as coisas dela pra fazer.<br />
E essa é a vida dela."<br /><br />

Capitulo 2<br />
---<br />
"Ainda no ano de 2019 havia uma lenda, de uma nave super inovativa. <br />
A empresa que fez essas naves era chamada pelo nome de ThinkOutsiteTheBox.<br />
As naves eram chamadas de "LonelyShips", por que você estava sozinho nelas.<br />
Tinha muitas pessoas que viviam nas LonelyShips, eles criaram uma comunidade.<br />
E muitos servidores de Discord foram criados para se comunicar e conversar sobre ser um LonelyShipper.<br />
Era como um movimento, um movimento social, igual os bronies, furries e 4channers eram alguns anos atrás.<br />
Esses três movimentos específicos ainda estão ativos, mas eles não são tão famosos quanto antes.<br />
Eles gostavam de estar naquele movimento, Lisa não participava disso.<br />
Ela era só ela, passando tempo no computador, sem um movimento ou estereótipo.<br />
Tinha também um garoto chamado John, ele tinha 17 anos, ele gostava de jogar jogos.<br />
Muitos jogos, ele era bem competitivo neles, e não gostava de perder.<br />
Ele estava na sua LonelyShip, ele não sabia que hora era na terra.<br />
Ele só queria jogar jogos, ele estava pensando algumas coisas enquanto estava deitado em sua cama.<br />
Ele pensou: "Por que eu estou nessa cama?, eu estava muito sozinho, e eu queria ficar longe dos outros,<br />
por que eles me enfureciam, eu estava sofrendo por causa deles, e eu estava sendo irritado por eles também,<br />
Eu também sinto que eu era alguem em algum outro lugar ou universo alternativo,<br />
Como se eu fosse algum tipo de herói ou professor de artes marciais, como se eu estivesse ensinando alguns amigos,<br />
E eu estava e ensinando duas pessoas, Juju e Sizaque eu acho,<br />
Eu deveria parar de pensar sobre isso, talvez eu esteja muito cansado ou algo assim, eu deveria voltar para o computador".<br />
Então John levantou de sua cama e ligou o computador, ele abriu a Steam para jogar alguma coisa.<br />
John também tinha um amigo chamado Mark, John sentiu que eles eram amigos em um universo alternativo.<br />
John abriu Apex Legends para jogar, era um novo jogo que a EA lançou, ele queria testar.<br />
Ele jogou por alguns minutos e gostou, ele era muito bom no jogo.<br />
Então ele fechou o jogo e chamou seu amigo Mark para jogar Overwatch no Discord.<br />
Eles jogaram um pouco enquanto conversavam por chamada-de-voz, Mark também vivia em uma LonelyShip.<br />
Depois de um tempo jogando John venceu alguns rounds e queria sair, ele disse "Até mais" para Mark.<br />
Mark disse o mesmo, John gostava de ler algumas histórias na internet, ele queria escrever também.<br />
Mas ele não era muito bom nisso, ele gostava de ler as histórias de uma garota chamada Lisa, que era uma LonelyShipper também.<br />
Lisa publicou muitas histórias, ela adorava escrever aquelas.<br />
John estava estudando escrita e história para aprender um pouco, ele já fez alguns rascunhos no computador dele.<br />
Ele queria falar com Lisa, para pedir ajuda dela em escrita, ele notou que ela coloca o nome e id do Discord em todas as histórias dela.<br />
O texto dizia: "Se você quer ajuda em escrita ou gosta das minhas histórias e quer conversar sobre elas me adiciona no Discord: Lisa#3860".<br />
Então John adicionou ela no Discord, John já dava gosteis e comentava nos capítulos de algumas histórias de Lisa.<br />
Mas ele queria conversar com ela e perguntar coisas a ela, sobre escrita e como escrever melhor.<br />

John mandou uma mensagem para ela, ele disse: "Oi, como você tá?, eu sou John do Wattpad, eu amo suas histórias".<br />
"Você escreveu seu Discord nas suas histórias certo?, você disse que as pessoas podiam pedir ajuda em escrita ou conversar sobre suas histórias".<br />
"Desculpa perguntar muitas coisas, é que eu comecei a alguns meses atrás, e estava tentando ficar melhor em escrever".<br />
Depois de um tempo John notou que ela estava online, ele ficou animado para receber uma resposta.<br />
Lisa respondeu: "Hey, John, eu conheço você do Wattpad :), você comenta e me da muitos likes, obrigado por amar minhas histórias,<br />
E obrigado por comentar e dar gosteis nelas, sim, eu fiz isso, você pode me pedir ajuda ou conversar comigo sobre minhas histórias :3,<br />
Tudo bem fazer perguntas, eu comecei a alguns meses atrás também, posso ver um pouco do seu trabalho?, tipo, a história que você mais se orgulha".<br />
Então John respondeu: "Sim, eu vou mandar um arquivo de texto, ok?".<br />
"Ok então", disse Lisa.<br />
Então John mandou para Lisa um arquivo de nome "The Return of the Beast.txt" de 4KB.<br />
Depois de um tempo lendo Lisa começou a escrever uma mensagem para John, ela disse:<br />
"Isso foi legal de ler, a história estava interessante, mas o jeito que você executou ela, aquilo foi meio..."<br />
John: "Ruim?".<br />
Lisa: "Não ruim, mas, não foi... o jeito que você se expressa, ou o jeito que você escreve, tipo, tenta ler mais".<br />
Lisa: "Tenta ler mais e aprender a como usar palavras, e como formar frases, eu acho que essa é minha dica Monika-".<br />
Lisa: "Quero dizer, eu acho que essa é minha dica para você, tente isso".<br />
John: "Ok, eu vou tentar isso, obrigado por me ajudar, tipo, eu estava assustado e animado para falar com você".<br />
Lisa: "Por que?".<br />
John: "Porque eu amo o seu trabalho, e achei que você era uma pessoa inacessível".<br />
Lisa: "Se eu fosse inacessível por que colocaria minha tag do discord nas minhas histórias?, alem disso, eu vivo em uma LonelyShip, então eu sou muito acessível".<br />
John: "Oh, isso é legal, eu vivo em uma também, qual sua idade?".<br />
Lisa: "16, e você?, meu nome é lisa a propósito".<br />
John: "17, meu nome é John".<br />
Lisa: "Ok John, eu gostei de falar com você, mas eu vou escrever um "The Odds of Nature" agora, ok?".<br />
John: "Ok, desculpa incomodar".<br />
Lisa: "Você não me incomoda, também gostaria de ler suas histórias quando você ficar melhor :)".<br />
John: "Seria uma honra te mandar alguma delas".<br />
Lisa: "Ok, vejo você mais tarde John :3".<br />
John: "Vejo você mais tarde Lisa :)".<br />
Depois disso John minimizou sua janela do Discord e começou a pesquisar como escrever melhor e como usar palavras melhor.<br />
Ele queria ficar bom na escrita para mostrar Lisa as histórias dele, ele estava muito animado para fazer isso.<br />
Ele aprendeu muito, e estava tentando fazer alguns rascunhos.<br />
Depois de algum tempo ele escreveu algo que ele gostou, ele estava cansado, ele bocejou e relaxou na cadeira. --(Autor: suco de laranja)<br />
Ele desligou o computador e deitou na cama para dormir, ele queria conversar com Lisa novamente.<br />
Ele dormiu."<br /><br />

Capitulo 3<br />
---<br />
"John acordou e ligou seu computador, ele abriu a geladeira e pegou um bolo de limão.<br />
Ele colocou o prato com o bolo de limão na mesa onde o computador estava.<br />
Ele abriu a Steam para jogar alguns jogos, ele jogou Transport Defender e Zombidle por 30 minutos.<br />
Depois disso ele abriu o Notepad++ para escrever algumas histórias, ou talvez um rascunho que ele estava tentando melhorar.<br />
Ele trabalhou um pouco no rascunho e pensou que estava bom, ele salvou o arquivo, então depois disso ele baixou alguns vídeos do Youtube para assistir.<br />
Ele baixou 3 vídeos do Alanzoka e 3 do Cellbit Jogando.<br />
John tinha um site onde ele colocava os vídeos e um botão verde chamado "Watch" era adicionado vinculando ao arquivo de vídeo local que ele tinha.<br />
Ele assistiu alguns vídeos e então fechou a aba do site, ele usou VLC Media Player para assistir aqueles vídeos.<br />
John também gostava de jogar Minecraft, ele tinha 3 servidores na lista de servers do Minecraft.<br />
Ele gostava de jogar survival e skyblock nesses servidores, John gostava da "fanbase" daqueles servidores.<br />
John jogou um pouco nesses servidores, ele tinha amigos lá.<br />
Ele fechou o jogo e começou a conversar com seus amigos no Discord, ele gostava dos amigos que tinha.<br />
Era 11:00AM lá, mas ele não sabia a diferença entre dia e noite por que ele não tinha luz ou um sol perto dali.<br />
Então a cena mudou para Lisa, ela estava escrevendo The Odds of Nature, ela terminou o capítulo atual e salvou.<br />
Depois disso ela postou a história no Wattpad, depois de uns minutos o capítulo tinha 5 visualizações e 2 comentários.<br />
Lisa estava feliz sobre isso, ela gostava de ter uma fanbase ou ter pessoas que gostavam de ler as histórias que ela escrevia.<br />
Depois disso, Lisa abriu a Netflix para assistir alguma série, ela gostava de assistir The Walking Dead.<br />
Lisa estava no segundo episódio da sétima temporada, ela gostava da história e dos personagens, mas também estava com um pouco de medo de assistir.<br />
O aplicativo do Discord estava aberto no computador dela, quando ela começou a assistir The Walking Dead S07E03, os detalhes do que ela estava assistindo apareceram no perfil dela do Discord.<br />
Ela pausou o vídeo e pegou pipoca e coca-cola da geladeira dela, ela gostava de comer pipoca enquanto assistia coisas.<br />
Então ela sentou na cadeira e pois o vídeo pra tocar, ela comeu enquanto assistia, então o episódio acabou, ela fechou o aplicativo da Netflix.<br />
Então Lisa trocou para o Discord, ela queria falar com os amigos dela no Discord, ela notou que John estava online.<br />
Lisa começou a falar com ele, ela disse: "Oi, você melhorou na escrita?".<br />
Depois de um tempo John respondeu: "Sim, eu pesquisei na internet como ficar melhor na escrita, e escrevi um rascunho hoje".<br />
Então Lisa disse: "Oh, isso é legal, posso ver?".<br />
John disse: "Sim, é claro, eu vou te mandar o arquivo?, ok?".<br />
Então Lisa respondeu: "Ok".<br />
John mandou um arquivo para ela de nome: "Bubbles and Cream" de 5KB.<br />
Lisa disse: "Eu vou ler isso agora".<br />
Depois de um tempo Lisa respondeu dizendo: "Eu acho que isso é melhor do que a outra história que você me mandou, tipo... o jeito que você escreveu".<br />
"A gramática está melhor também, eu gostei da história, eu acho que o conceito é interessante, você deveria postar ela em algum lugar, tipo Wattpad".<br />
"Eu ficaria feliz de ler ela no Wattpad :)".<br />
Então John respondeu: "Oh, ok, eu estou feliz que você pense isso de minha história, eu tentei ficar melhor em escrita só por que eu te admiro muito".<br />
"E eu queria te fazer orgulhosa de mim ou algo assim, então obrigado por gostar de minha história, e obrigado por me ajudar a ficar melhor na escrita".<br />
"Eu vou postar ela no Wattpad, obrigado pela sugestão".<br />
Então Lisa respondeu: "Oh, eu to feliz de ajudar você e de inspirar você também, obrigado por isso :)".<br />
"Eu vou fazer outra coisa agora, ok, te vejo depois :3".<br />
Então John respondeu: "Te vejo depois".<br />
Lisa estava tão feliz que ela inspirou John a ficar melhor na escrita, aquilo fez ela querer fazer mais histórias e escrever mais.<br />
Então Lisa abriu o Steam para jogar alguns jogos, ela abriu o Apex Legends pra jogar um pouco.<br />
Ela gostava do jogo, ela queria jogar mais, mas estava um pouco cansada para jogar.<br />
Ela ganhou uma partida e fechou o jogo, ela tinha outros amigos no Discord também.<br />
Lisa queria falar com Anny, pra jogar algo e tals, Anny tinha um Discord também.<br />
Então Lisa mandou uma mensagem para Anny no Discord dizendo: "Eae, quer jogar alguma coisa hoje?".<br />
Então Anny respondeu: "Sim, eu quero fazer isso, mas o que você quer jogar?".<br />
Lisa disse: "Eu não sei, um pouco de GTA V, ou Terraria se você quiser".<br />
Anny disse: "Eu queria jogar os dois".<br />
Então Lisa e Anny entraram em um servidor privado no Discord para ir em uma chamada de voz, Lisa chamou um bot de musica para a chamada para ouvir musica enquanto joga.<br />
Lisa e Anny jogaram GTA V Online, elas gostavam daquele jogo, então depois disso Lisa disse que ia fazer outra coisa.<br />
Lisa estava procurando no Wattpad algumas histórias para ler, ela descobriu que a história "A Vida de Pequenata" recebeu um novo capítulo, o capítulo 18.<br />
A história era escrita por um usuário chamado "2ekats", Lisa gostava daquela história, ela gostava de ver Pequenata e Júlia vivendo suas vidas.<br />
Ela amou o capítulo e deu um voto e comentou nele, depois de um tempo o autor respondeu dizendo:<br />
"Oi, obrigado por votar na minha história, e obrigado por gostar e comentar nela, eu estou muito feliz de ver o seu feedback e comentários".<br />
Lisa estava feliz por dar feedback e comentar nas histórias que ela gostava.<br />
Então ela ligou o Playstation 4 dela e abriu um jogo chamado Need For Speed, ela gostava de jogar ele.<br />
Lisa jogou por um tempo e fechou o jogo, ela desligou o vídeo game.<br />
Ela sentiu fome, ela abriu a geladeira e lá estava um pacote de bolacha recheada de chocolate e um Doritos, e também um copo de coca-cola.<br />
Lisa pegou todas as coisas e colocou elas na mesa, ela abriu o pacote de bolachas e jogou eles em uma bacia de plástico.<br />
Ela abriu um filme para assistir na Netflix, o filme era chamado de "Os Vingadores: Guerra Infinita".<br />
Ela assistiu enquanto comia as bolachas, Doritos e bebia coca-cola, ela gostou do filme, ela adicionou ele na lista de "Filmes Assistidos".<br />
Lisa amava fazer arquivos de texto, ela tinha um amigo chamado Funkysnipa Cat, ela conheceu ele no Google+.<br />
Funkysnipa Cat foi o primeiro a comecar a conversa no Discord, Funkysnipa Cat e Lisa eram falantes nativos do idioma Português do Brasil.<br />
Funkysnipa Cat disse em português: "Oi".<br />
Então Lisa disse: "Oi".<br />
Eles conversaram um pouco e começaram a se conhecer de novo, eles gostavam de falar sobre histórias, eles tinham muito em comum.<br />
Funky e Lisa amavam escrever histórias, e Lisa queria escrever uma história junto com Funky algum dia.<br />
O nome real de Funky era Izaque, Lisa gostava de ser amiga dele.<br />
Depois de um tempo aprendendo sobre um ao outro, Izaque descobriu que Lisa vivia em uma LonelyShip.<br />
Izaque vivia no Planeta Terra normal, Izaque ensou que isso era um fato interessante sobre Lisa.<br />
No começo da conversa Izaque mandou para Lisa o link de seu perfil no Wattpad, Lisa e Izaque conversaram sobre histórias por um tempo.<br />
Eles também jogavam juntos algumas vezes, na verdade, o autor dessa história é Izaque ou Funkysnipa Cat.<br />
Sim, isso mesmo, eu sou Izaque e eu estou escrevendo sobre Lisa, minha querida amiga, isso é um pouco estranho de se fazer, não?.<br />
Por que muitas histórias não falam com o leitor, elas contam uma história para o leitor, mas é simplesmente isso, eu estou escrevendo uma história sobre minha amiga Lisa.<br />
Eu acho que você ta com a cara desse jeito agora: "O_O".<br />
De volta para o estilo de narrador.<br />
Lisa disse para Izaque o que ela fez nos dias que ela passou na espaço nave, para que ele pudesse escrever os capítulos da história "SpaceLiving".<br />
Izaque amava escrever aquela história (*piscadela*).<br />
Izaque analizou o dia de Lisa e escreveu uma história sobre ele, então ele mandou o arquivo da história para Lisa.<br />
Lisa gostou e deu permissão para Izaque publicar a história e para mandar para os amigos dele.<br />
Izaque amava quando um amigo específico lia SpaceLiving, aquele amigo era mais que um amigo, aquela pessoa se chamava [...] (...).<br />
Lisa amava falar com Izaque, Lisa também sabia que [...] gostava de ler a história dela.<br />
Lisa queria falar com ela, Lisa pediu o contato de [...], Izaque disse que ela poderia falar com [...].<br />
Então [...] começou a conversar com Lisa, elas conversaram um pouco, Isa começou a conhecer Lisa um pouco melhor.<br />
Depois de um tempo elas pararam de conversar.<br />
Lisa pensou que ela tinha uma vida feliz, ela escrevia histórias, ela tinha bons amigos como Izaque, Isa e John.<br />
Ela se sentiu cansada, ela disse tchau para Izaque e desligou o computador.<br />
Ela deitou em sua cama e dormiu."<br /><br />

"Havia um menino que vivia em uma LonelyShip também, seu nome era "Ted".<br />
Mas a espaçonave dele era diferente, tinha um teletransportador.<br />
Ele poderia voltar para a Terra quando quisesse.<br />
Para ver sua família e saber as novidades da Terra.<br />
Ele era um pouco famoso em sua cidade, sendo uma das únicas pessoas que podiam deixar suas LonelyShips.<br />
Ele gostava de sua vida, ele ainda era um civil na Terra, mas ele gostava de viver em sua LonelyShip.<br />
Um dia ele estava sentado em seu computador, comendo um pouco de lasanha com coca-cola enquanto assistia a uma transmissão ao vivo do Youtuber Cellbit.<br />
Então, depois de comer, levantou-se e pegou uma garrafa de água, colocou a garrafa sobre a mesa.<br />
Ted então arrastou a janela da transmissão ao vivo para sua segunda tela e abriu o Netflix no navegador Mozilla Firefox.<br />
Ele deu uma olhada no catálogo, não encontrou nada que estivesse interessado em assistir.<br />
Então ele fechou o navegador e a transmissão ao vivo, e abriu o Steam para jogar alguns jogos, ele começou a jogar Terraria.<br />
Ele jogou em um servidor multi-player, ele jogou um pouco e depois fechou o jogo.<br />
Ted sentia falta de sua família e da vida na Terra, desligou o computador e ativou o teletransportador.<br />
Depois de esperar algum tempo, o teletransportador estava pronto, ele digitou e digitou o id do Planeta Terra.<br />
Ele foi teleportado para a Terra e apareceu na casa de seus pais.<br />
Seus pais estavam comendo, eles notaram que Ted estava lá, eles se levantaram para abraçar Ted.<br />
Os pais de Ted disseram que sentiam sua falta e choraram um pouco juntos.<br />
Então seus pais disseram que iriam ao mercado.<br />
Os pais de Ted saíram de casa e Ted disse que ia ao centro da cidade.<br />
Ted trancou a casa e pegou uma mochila com algumas coisas.<br />
Depois de caminhar um pouco Ted chegou ao centro da cidade, ele queria ver uma amiga dele.<br />
Com quem ele conversou na internet, ele também tinha um smartphone em sua LonelyShip.<br />
Seu pai se chamava Pedro, sua mãe se chamava Jana.<br />
Ted conheceu sua amiga há 2 anos.<br />
Sua amiga era uma garota chamada Monika, ele sabia onde ela morava.<br />
Ted enviou uma mensagem para Monika através de seu smartphone dizendo que ele estava indo para a casa dela.<br />
Monika disse que estava feliz com isso e que estava animada para vê-lo novamente.<br />
Então Ted começou a caminhar até a casa dela, ele chegou e bateu na porta.<br />
Monika abriu a porta e deixou Ted entrar.<br />
Então Monika disse a Ted que se sentisse em casa.<br />
Ted entrou na casa e sentou no sofá.<br />
Monika perguntou se ele queria um pouco de água, Ted respondeu positivamente.<br />
Então Monika trouxe um copo de água.<br />
Ted bebeu e devolveu a Monika.<br />
Monika então voltou para a cozinha e colocou o copo na pia.<br />
Monika voltou para a sala e sentou-se no sofá.<br />
Ted ficou um pouco desconfortável por causa disso.<br />
Ele não estava acostumado a estar tão perto de uma pessoa assim.<br />
Então Monika perguntou como ele estava, Ted disse que estava indo muito bem.<br />
Monika disse que gostava dele, ambos olhavam nos olhos um do outro.<br />
Ted corou um pouco e disse que também gostava de Monika.<br />
Então Ted perguntou se Monika gostava de viver assim na Terra.<br />
Monika ficou um pouco desconfortável com essa questão.<br />
Ela demorou um pouco para responder.<br />
Então Monika disse que gostava disso, mas gostaria de viver como uma LonelyShipper.<br />
Ted perguntou se ela queria passar algum tempo lá.<br />
Monika disse que queria, mas tinha medo de deixar sua casa sozinha.<br />
Então Ted disse que poderia chamar alguém de confiança para cuidar da casa.<br />
Monika disse que era uma boa ideia, então ela disse que pensaria nisso por um tempo.<br />
Ted disse que era bom vê-la novamente e que ela ainda era bonita.<br />
Monika corou um pouco e disse: "Obrigado!"<br />
Então Monika disse que ele era bonito também.<br />
Ted disse "Obrigado...".<br />
Monika disse: "Você não quer ficar para tomar um café?".<br />
Ted respondeu: "Ah, tudo bem".<br />
Então Monika levantou-se e caminhou em direção à cozinha, ela começou a fazer café.<br />
Ted sentou-se na cadeira e esperou que Monika preparasse o café.<br />
Conversaram um pouco e depois o café ficou pronto.<br />
Monika e Ted sentaram-se à mesa e Monika serviu café e leite para Ted.<br />
Ted disse: "Hmm... eu quero te perguntar uma coisa".<br />
Então Monika disse: "O que é?".<br />
Ted disse: "Uma menina bonita como você deve ter um namorado certo?".<br />
Então Monika respondeu corada e tímida: "Ah... haha, obrigada Ted mas eu não tenho namorado".<br />
Ted disse: "Oh... então... nós já nos conhecemos muito bem?"<br />
Monika disse: "Sim... e eu gosto muito de você...".<br />
Ted disse: "Eu também...".<br />
Monika aproximou-se de Ted e disse: "Então... você gosta de mim mais do que amiga?...".<br />
Ted disse: "O que isso significaria?...".<br />
Monika disse: "Isso... como... como namorada?".<br />
Ted era um pouco tímido e disse: "Uhh... talvez... hmm... você quer ser minha namorada?".<br />
Monika corou e disse: "Sim...".<br />
Então Ted abraçou Monika, Monika beijou Ted.<br />
Monika disse: "Eu quero ir com você para a sua LonelyShip...".<br />
Ted disse: "Você tem certeza disso?".<br />
Monika disse: "Sim, eu te amo!".<br />
Ted disse: "Eu também te amo querida, estou feliz que você quer morar comigo".<br />
Monika disse: "Estou feliz também".<br />
Então Monika começou a arrumar suas coisas.<br />
Monika deu sua casa para um parente e pegou os 30.000 dólares que tinha em uma conta bancária.<br />
Então Monika chegou à casa de Ted e eles estavam preparados para se teletransportar para a LonelyShip.<br />
Eles se teletransportaram e saíram do teletransportador.<br />
Quando Monika saiu do teletransportador, a espaçonave começou a tremer um pouco e as mesas e paredes estavam se movendo e mudando.<br />
Depois de algum tempo um novo computador, PS4, cama, banheiro e geladeira estava lá.<br />
Monika colocou suas coisas no chão e se aproximou da cama, na parede da cama havia alguns botões.<br />
Ela apertou um botão rosa e a cama, a geladeira, a mesa e as paredes foram pintadas de rosa.<br />
Monika disse: "Isso é incrível", e abraçou Ted.<br />
Ted disse: "Sim, é!".<br />
Havia também um guarda-roupa lá, Monika guardou suas coisas lá.<br />
Ela deitou na cama e disse: "Esta espaçonave é muito legal".<br />
Ted disse: "Sim".<br />
Monika estava preparada para começar uma nova vida naquela espaçonave, fazendo um monte de coisas e estando com a pessoa que ama.<br />
Ted disse: "Esta não é mais uma LonelyShip, é uma LovelyShip, haha".<br />
Monika disse: "Sim, lol"."<br /><br />

E seu parente aceitará seu pedido para gerar um Teleporter lá,<br />

É o fim do log de alterações, isso foi escrito pela ThinkOutsideTheBox, defenda-se dos asteróides, fique seguro, cuide-se e seja solitário! :) ".<br />
<i>*A mensagem desaparece...*</i><br />
Uma LonelyShipper estava vendo essa mensagem, ela estava em sua LonelyShip, as paredes da espaçonave tinham a cor azul marinho,<br />
Ela tinha uma cama, ThoughtPoweredFridge(GeladeiraAlimentadaporPensamento), banheiro, um computador, Smartphone e PS4, ela também tinha um teclado musical,<br />
Ela adorava aprender e treinar com o teclado, ela era muito boa nisso, em algum momento ela mandou um cover da música "Faded" para um amigo,<br />
Esse amigo se chamava Izaque, Izaque gostou do cover da música e disse que Wendy tinha talento,<br />
Wendy ficou muito feliz ao ler isso, Wendy também gostava de jogar alguns jogos no computador,<br />
Ela adorava comer também, porque era fácil comer em uma LonelyShip, você só pensa na comida, abre a Geladeira e a comida vai estar lá,<br />
Izaque gostava de escrever algumas histórias, ele enviava o link de um novo capítulo para Wendy toda vez que ele fazia um,<br />
Wendy gostava de ler as histórias de Izaque, Izaque achava que Wendy era realmente uma boa amiga e gostava de falar com ela.<br />
Eles conversaram usando Discord, quando Izaque descobriu que Wendy era um LonelyShipper também, ele ficou mais feliz do que antes,<br />
Izaque amava sua LonelyShip, Wendy também, Izaque adorava ouvir um pouco de Dubstep em sua nave, tocando nos alto-falantes,<br />
Izaque também fez transmissões ao vivo no Twitch, mostrando o que ele estava fazendo, aos seus assinantes,<br />
Ele gostava de baixar músicas do SoundCloud, de jogar na Steam, de escrever histórias e postar no Wattpad, Fanfiction e nos sites que ele fazia sozinho,<br />
Wendy gostava de ouvir música calma e assistir a vídeos no Youtube.<br />
Um dia Izaque estava lendo uma história muito boa e atmosférica no site da Fimfiction,<br />
Era sobre o desenho My Little Pony e o jogo Don't Starve juntos, ele recomendou a história para Wendy,<br />
Ele gostava tanto dessas duas coisas, e essas coisas juntas eram melhores que qualquer coisa,<br />
Houve um dia em que Izaque não fez uma transmissão ao vivo(livestream), ele assistiu a um filme chamado Os Vingadores: Guerra Infinita,<br />
Ele comeu pizzas, hambúrgueres e muita coca-cola enquanto assistia ao filme de duas horas,<br />
Ele adorava fazer isso, assistir aquele filme incrível, Izaque adicionou o filme à sua lista de assistidos em seu site chamado Watch History,<br />
Izaque também usou um software em seu computador chamado Foobar2000, que era um Music Player, Izaque tinha 25Gigabytes de música no disco rígido,<br />
Ele gostava de ter muita música e se denominava um Music Hoarder,<br />
Izaque também era amigo de um dos fundadores da ThinkOutsideTheBox, ele gostou da nova atualização que eles fizeram para as LonelyShips,<br />
a Double-Ship, WallColorChange, ShipInvite, EquipmentChange, ele gostou de todas as novas mudanças e novos recursos,<br />
Izaque gostava de ser um LonelyShipper e viver numa LonelyShip,<br />
Ele até criou um Discord Server sobre isso, e conversou com muitos amigos no Discord sobre como se tornar um LonelyShipper,<br />
Wendy também gostava de dormir, e para tocar teclado em sua nave espacial, ela adorava ser uma LonelyShipper,<br />
Quando ela ainda estava na terra, ela queria viver sozinha, gostava de usar o computador e o smartphone,<br />
Ela gostava de ver as estrelas, os planetas e a terra de sua janela,<br />
Wendy teve um pouco de sorte também, porque nenhum asteróide cruzou o caminho de sua espaçonave,<br />
Izaque tinha um asteróide vindo na direção de sua espaçonave, então o sistema de segurança foi ativado e uma grande torre de laser apareceu no topo da espaçonave,<br />
Destruindo completamente o asteróide, Izaque não se assustou com o asteróide, porque sabia como a espaçonave funcionava e sabia que ela o protegeria.<br />
Ele adorava estudar e aprender sobre as LonelyShips, SpaceLiving e a empresa ThinkOutsideTheBox,<br />
Com a nova atualização 1.3.709, Izaque e Wendy puderam visitar suas famílias, eles gostaram disso, vê-los novamente,<br />
Izaque sentia falta de sua família, ele abraçou todos eles, suas irmãs, seu irmão, seu pai e sua mãe,<br />
Ele estava acostumado a estar na terra e a conversar com humanos, mesmo que tivesse passado muito tempo dentro da LonelyShip,<br />
Izaque perguntou se alguém queria morar lá com ele, mas ninguém queria,<br />
Então ele disse "Até mais" a todos eles, ele entrou no Teleporter que estava na casa de seus pais,<br />
E voltou para a LonelyShip, uma voz feminina robô cumprimentou-o, dizendo: "Bem-vindo de volta, Izaque",<br />
Izaque instalou essa voz usando o Desktop App "SpaceLiving ThinkOutsideTheBox",<br />
A espaçonave de Izaque já tinha muita coisa boa e bom equipamento, uma boa tela, PS4,<br />
Bom computador, boa internet, ele estava feliz com o que tinha,<br />
Ele queria falar mais com Lisa, Wendy, Igor e outros amigos que ele tinha no Discord,<br />
Ele queria falar mais no servidor "Discord do Cellbit",<br />
Izaque estava cansado, ele ouviu algumas músicas de Dubstep em seu computador, depois assistiu a um pequeno episódio do anime Eromanga Sensei enquanto comia biscoitos de chocolate,<br />
Ele adicionou o episódio à sua lista de observação e desligou o computador, deitou-se na cama e dormiu."<br /><br />

Capitulo 6<br />
---<br />
(Esta é a explicação de um... deixe-me criar um nome legal para isso... um "SpaceLivingTeleportExperience"(ExperienciadeTeleportedaSpaceLiving))<br />
Era um dia lindo no mundo de SpaceLiving, mesmo que não haja sol perto das naves espaciais.<br />
Lisa, Izaque, Wendy, John, Ted e Monika estavam todos dentro de suas naves espaciais, vivendo felizes e usando o computador.<br />
Lisa estava desenhando um pouco enquanto assistia a um anime chamado "Eromanga Sensei", ela se sentiu inspirada por isso, porque tinha uma garota que desenhava também.<br />
Ela estava feliz desenhando enquanto assistia seu anime favorito, era engraçado, bonito, feliz, ela adorou.<br />
O anime conta a história de uma irmãzinha que desenha desenhos eróticos e um irmão mais velho que escreve histórias e light novels.<br />
Lisa adorava assistir aquele anime, ela estava assistindo pela vigésima terceira vez.<br />
Ela fez o download em HD no computador, só para assistir de novo e de novo.<br />
O anime lembrava seu irmão mais velho, ela o amava muito.<br />
Mas então ela ficou deprimida, triste e só queria ficar em seu quarto, ele estava triste com isso.<br />
Ela estava com fome o dia todo, mas não tinha motivação para comer.<br />
Ela só ficou no quarto dela, as luzes estavam apagadas, ela estava fazendo coisas em seu computador.<br />
Então ela chegou a um ponto em sua vida que ela estava fraca e magra, ela percebeu que sua vida era ruim.<br />
Lisa queria sair de lá, ela estava com medo, ela queria ir para a escola só para fazer seus pais felizes.<br />
Sua família estava triste com ela, ela queria sair de lá, quando ela foi dormir, era 05:12 da manhã.<br />
Ela estava dormindo em sua cama, ela teve um sonho, um sonho onde ela foi teleportada para uma nave espacial que tinha paredes brancas.<br />
Um computador, PS4, uma geladeira que cria qualquer alimento que você pensa, uma cama, um guarda-roupa, um smartphone na mesa.<br />
Ela pensou que era incrível e maravilhoso, ter todas as coisas que você precisa para usar o computador.<br />
Ter comida e água quando quiser e ter um computador super bom.<br />
Ela queria ficar lá para sempre, seus olhos estavam brilhando.<br />
Tudo era novo para ela, ela se aproximou da mesa e ligou o computador pressionando o botão no gabinete do computador.<br />
Ele carregou o Windows 10, era como se ela tivesse formatado o computador, ela digitou o nome do usuário.<br />
Uma senha e, em seguida, a tela inicial do Windows 10 apareceu, ele tinha o Mozilla Firefox, Spotify, Windows Explorer e o SpaceLiving Desktop App instalado.<br />
Ela abriu o Firefox, a página inicial era DuckDuckGo, os favoritos do navegador eram: DuckDuckGo, YouTube, Facebook, SoundCloud, SuperAnimes, Wattpad, MyAnimeList.<br />
Ela abriu o YouTube e conectou sua conta.<br />
Então Lisa abriu o DuckDuckGo e baixou o Youtube-DLG, era um aplicativo que ela usava em seu computador pessoal.<br />
O computador também tinha o Steam instalado, Lisa conectou-se com sua conta Steam.<br />
Ela abriu o Windows Explorer, viu que o computador tinha 5 SSDs, cada um com 10TB de espaço.<br />
Seus olhos brilharam vendo isso, porque ela só tinha 500GB de HD em seu computador.<br />
Ela mudou para o Steam e disse a ele para baixar todos os jogos que ela tinha.<br />
Então Lisa abriu o site Mega, ela logou em sua conta e baixou o aplicativo, instalou e colocou para baixar todos os seus 2TB de arquivos.<br />
Ela estava amando isso, montando e organizando seu novo espaço de trabalho.<br />
Depois de deixar o Steam e a Mega fazerem seus trabalhos, Lisa estava com um pouco de fome, aproximou-se da geladeira e uma tela que estava ligada a ela se acendeu.<br />
A tela mostrou um monte de texto, como se fosse um tutorial sobre como usar a geladeira, Lisa achou que era bastante intuitivo.<br />
Ela aprendeu a usar a geladeira, pensou em pizza, abriu a geladeira e uma fatia de pizza estava lá.<br />
Lisa achou incrível, fechou a geladeira, pensou em uma coca-cola e abriu a geladeira.<br />
Uma lata de coca cola estava lá, ela pegou e fechou a geladeira.<br />
Ela voltou para a mesa do computador e colocou a pizza e a lata no topo da mesa.<br />
Lisa começou a organizar seus arquivos Mega, ela gostava de fazer sites, ela tinha um site onde ela tinha um histórico do que assistiu.<br />
Ela baixou alguns animes em um site chamado SuperAnimes, Lisa baixou o primeiro episódio do anime "Eromanga Sensei".<br />
Lisa achou interessante e queria dar uma chance para ele.<br />
Ela começou a assistir enquanto comia a pizza e bebia coca cola, ela adorava fazer isso.<br />
Lisa adicionou o episódio ao histórico de assistidos e ao arquivo AniCartoMovie.txt, ela limpou as mãos e a boca.<br />
Então ela percebeu que esqueceu algo, "Discord!, eu esqueci dele", ela pensou, Lisa baixou Discord e logou em sua conta.<br />
Ela estava tão feliz em fazer o download novamente, e usá-lo novamente, ela pensou que era um sonho.<br />
Lisa sabia que o Google+ ia morrer em breve, ela estava triste com isso, mas ela estava feliz em começar a vida nova, mas não tão nova dela.<br />
Ela tinha um amigo especial no Google+, esse amigo se chamava Funkysnipa Cat ou Izaque na vida real.<br />
Ela adorava conversar com aquele amigo, ela abriu o Hangouts e pediu seu nome e identificação do Discord.<br />
Izaque deu a ela, ela o adicionou em Discord e eles começaram a conversar, Lisa queria conhecê-lo mais.<br />
Conversaram muito e sabiam muito mais um do outro, Lisa ficou feliz conversando com Izaque.<br />
Lisa queria se expressar melhor e escrever alguma coisa, ela queria escrever palavras em seu computador.<br />
Então ela conversou com Izaque sobre isso, Izaque sugeriu que Lisa começasse a escrever histórias.<br />
Ela gostou da idéia, Izaque disse para Lisa baixar o Notepad++, ele disse que é um bom programa para escrever.<br />
Lisa baixou o programa e começou seu primeiro rascunho de uma história, ela escreveu por alguns minutos.<br />
Ela gostou do resultado, depois salvou o arquivo e o enviou para sua nuvem Mega.<br />
Izaque disse para ela postar sua história no Wattpad, porque era uma boa plataforma para escritores.<br />
Lisa criou uma conta lá e postou sua história, o nome da história era "The Odds of Nature".<br />
Depois de esperar algum tempo, Lisa recarregou a página e havia 10 visualizações nela e um comentário.<br />
O autor do comentário foi "stake2", Lisa mudou para Discord e perguntou se Izaque tinha uma conta no Wattpad.<br />
Izaque disse que sim, Lisa voltou ao Firefox para ler o comentário, stake2 estava elogiando a história de Lisa, ela estava feliz com isso.<br />
Ela gostou do comentário e respondeu agradecendo à stake2, ela ficou muito feliz com esse comentário.<br />
Em seguida, Lisa mudou para Discord e pediu o link da conta do Izaque no Wattpad.<br />
Izaque enviou o link para Lisa, surpreendentemente era stake2, Lisa estava muito feliz com isso.<br />
Ela mudou para Discord para agradecer a Izaque por isso, Lisa disse que adorou escrever o primeiro capítulo.<br />
Izaque disse: "Comecei assim, bem, eu escrevi a Ilha Deserta, não fiquei muito feliz com essa história, foi a minha primeira história".<br />
Então Izaque disse: "Eu fiz a Ilha Deserta em 2016, quando estava lendo uma história futurista muito legal, fiquei feliz com o sentimento que a escrita me deu,<br />
então eu nunca parei até hoje."<br />
Lisa disse: "Oh, eu estou feliz em saber disso, eu amo escrever, vou ler sua história chamada "Life of Littletato", eu gostei de saber como você começou a escrever,<br />
obrigado por me ensinar muito sobre a escrita."<br />
Então Izaque disse: "Eu não sei muito, mas obrigado por ouvir, aprender e dizer que meu conhecimento foi útil :), hehe, eu gosto muito de você Lisa :3".<br />
Lisa disse: "Eu gosto muito de você também Izaque, hehe :3".<br />
Então o Steam terminou de baixar todos os jogos do Lisa, ela queria jogar um, ela abriu o Grand Theft Auto 5 para jogar um pouco.<br />
Ela tinha alguns mods instalados, ela adorava jogar esse jogo, dirigir carros e outras coisas.<br />
Lisa jogou um pouco e parou, ela fechou o jogo, ela estava com fome de novo, levantou-se e pensou em um hambúrguer e uma coca-cola.<br />
Ela abriu a geladeira e lá estava um hambúrguer em um prato e uma lata de coca-cola.<br />
Lisa baixou um episódio da sexta temporada da série "The Walking Dead", ela esperou que ele fosse baixado e abriu no VLC Media Player.<br />
Ela pensou que era estranho comer enquanto assistia a série, mas ela não conseguia lidar com sua fome, então ela assistiu enquanto comia.<br />
Foi triste assistir essa série, às vezes as pessoas morrem e você termina o episódio triste.<br />
Ela terminou de assistir e comer, acrescentou o episódio à sua lista de assistidos.<br />
Sentia-se cansada e queria usar o banheiro, usou-o e foi até a cama, deitou-se na cama e tentou fechar os olhos.<br />
Lisa pensou: "Isso é realmente um sonho?, parece muito real...", então Lisa tentou se beliscar.<br />
Ela não acordou, ficou surpresa com isso.<br />
Então Lisa dormiu, esperando para ir mais no computador."<br /><br />

Capitulo 7<br />
---<br />
[No último capítulo, Lisa não estava sonhando, ela realmente se teletransportou para a nave espacial, não era um sonho]<br />
Outro dia no mundo de SpaceLiving, circulava um boato sobre uma nave espacial de grupo, 4 amigos que eram tão próximos e se conheciam tão bem.<br />
Eles foram teleportados para a espaçonave juntos, esse boato estava se espalhando rapidamente, os usuários das LonelyShips estavam falando muito sobre isso.<br />
Eles criaram teorias e grupos, contas falsas no Discord sobre isso.<br />
Havia também uma história, criada e escrita por um usuário do Discord e Wattpad, chamado stake2.<br />
Era sobre as ações e a vida daquele grupo específico em sua LonelyShip.<br />
O nome do grupo era... Gang Da Suruba.<br />
Algumas pessoas achavam que stake2 era residente na espaçonave do Gang Da Suruba (GDS), porque a história tinha muitos detalhes.<br />
Em algum momento, em 2019 ou 2020, eu acho.<br />
4 amigos enviaram mensagens no servidor oficial da SpaceLiving no Discord.<br />
Seus nomes eram Drag, Manuh, Funkysnipa Cat e kendrinhah.<br />
Um dos membros enviou uma selfie do grupo, foi Manuh.<br />
Manuh e Drag estavam lutando no fundo da foto.<br />
Kendra estava tirando a foto e Funkysnipa Cat estava apenas batendo cabeça(headbangano) para dubstep na cama.<br />
Os usuários que estavam olhando para o chat começaram a falar sobre isso.<br />
Um deles disse: "Eles são o grupo raro que foi teleportado para uma LonelyShip!".<br />
John também estava lá, ele disse: "Ah, eu gostaria de viver em uma espaçonave com meus amigos".<br />
Funkysnipa Cat disse: "E esse sou eu, headbangando para dubstep na cama".<br />
Drag disse: "Eu estou lutando na parte de trás da foto com a Manuh".<br />
kendrinhah disse: "E eu estou tirando a foto".<br />
Um usuário aleatório disse: "Esta é a primeira foto de uma nave espacial, nunca vimos uma foto de uma LonelyShip".<br />
Ted disse: "Sim, é verdade, alguém tem que dizer a ThinkOutsideTheBox".<br />
Um administrador do SpaceLiving disse: "Eles já sabem disso, já que ativaram esse recurso, apenas para esse grupo específico,<br />
Então eles devem se sentir especiais".<br />
Ted disse: "Ah, tudo bem, eles deveriam se sentir felizes".<br />
O administrador disse: "Sim...".<br />
Depois de algum tempo as pessoas pararam de falar sobre eles, um membro do grupo começou a transmitir no Twitch.<br />
Mostrando suas coisas, como ele escreve histórias e, surpreendentemente, Funkysnipa Cat era stake2.<br />
E a história era real, a história era sobre o grupo da Gang Da Suruba.<br />
As pessoas que estavam assistindo fizeram muitas perguntas para stake2, qual era o nome dele, ele respondeu que seu nome era Izaque.<br />
Manuh, Drag e Kendra entraram no quarto de Izaque, um de cada vez, para se apresentarem para os espectadores de Izaque.<br />
Depois de um tempo Izaque fechou a livestream, ele queria dormir um pouco, ele fechou a porta e deitou em sua cama.<br />
Kendra estava dormindo também, Izaque sonhou um pouco, pensando que ele amava morar lá com seus amigos.<br />
No dia seguinte, Izaque acordou e abriu a porta, ele ligou o computador e viu um anúncio no Servidor do Discord Oficial da SpaceLiving.<br />
Era uma notificação dizendo que naquele dia, às 18:00, todos os LonelyShippers ou moradores de uma LonelyShip seriam teleportados para uma grande nave espacial.<br />
Para fazer uma festa, também por causa desse evento específico (o grupo GDS), para os LonelyShippers conhecerem outros LonelyShippers.<br />
Izaque disse a Drag, Kendra e Manuh sobre isso, Manuh disse em português:<br />
"Mas eles não podem simplesmente nos teletransportar para lá, e não alguém não quiser ir?".<br />
Izaque disse em português: "Bom... eles fizeram isso pra nós trazer pra cá kk".<br />
Manuh respondeu: "Até que faz sentido".<br />
Depois de algum tempo, eram 18:00, os LonelyShippers olhavam para seus relógios no computador, de repente estavam flutuando, depois todos apareceram em uma única nave espacial.<br />
Todos olharam um para o outro, Ted estava perto de Monika, John sorriu para Lisa e Lisa sorriu de volta, Izaque abraçou Lisa e Lisa aceitou o abraço.<br />
Kendra ficou um pouco ciumenta por causa disso, Izaque então sorriu para Wendy e Wendy sorriu de volta.<br />
Manuh disse a Kendra que, se ela fosse ela, ficaria brava com Wendy e Lisa.<br />
Kendra achou que ela não estava com raiva ou não era tão extrema quanto Manuh.<br />
Izaque conversou um pouco com Lisa, Wendy, John, Ted, Monika, ele adorava conversar cara a cara com pessoas que ele conversava pela internet.<br />
Wendy e Lisa estavam tão felizes com isso, todo mundo estava conversando, era uma visão incrível, muitas pessoas com muitas coisas em comum.<br />
Conversando muito e estando no mesmo ambiente.<br />
Então uma tela apareceu na espaçonave, dizendo:<br />
"Esta foi uma reunião planejada para alguns dias no futuro, mas foi feita hoje porque sentimos vontade de fazer isso hoje".<br />
"Nós, da ThinkOutsideTheBox, queremos agradecer a todos vocês, e queremos dizer que estamos muito felizes em ter vocês aqui hoje".<br />
"Todos que participaram, todos que vivem dentro de uma LonelyShip, todos que vivem dentro de uma DoubleLonelyShip".<br />
"E algumas pessoas específicas... que vivem dentro de uma... NaveEspacial de Grupo :), todo mundo é importante".<br />
"E saber que criamos essas coisas, essas naves espaciais chamadas LonelyShips, para fazer as pessoas felizes".<br />
"Para fazer uma coisa boa, as naves são solitários, mas vocês estão todos aqui agora, conversando uns com os outros, conhecendo novas pessoas e fazendo amigos".<br />
"Também estamos comemorando aqui, comemorando... 2 anos da SpaceLiving Network, estamos muito felizes em ver todos os seus rostos".<br />
"E estamos felizes sabendo que nós fizemos vocês felizes, e provavelmente não solitários hoje, estamos felizes em dar vida aos seus pensamentos".<br />
"Estamos felizes e orgulhosos em tornar seus desejos uma realidade e fornecer a possibilidade de viver como vocês desejam".<br />
"Estamos muito felizes em escrever, viver e criar coisas para as pessoas que querem, então, obrigado a todos".<br />
"Todo mundo que lê a história também, Izaque, ou stake2 ou Funkysnipa Cat, você é um cara legal e esperto".<br />
"Obrigado por estar na nossa LonelyShip e obrigado por ser você mesmo e por existir, xD".<br />
"Obrigado por tudo, e vamos continuar a viver assim, e as naves espaciais continuarão a existir".<br />
"E... proteja-se dos asteróides, dubstep é bom, e seja solitário! (Bem, isso é uma coisa estranha para dizer depois do que aconteceu hoje)".<br />
A tela desaparece, um botão para se teleportar de volta para sua nave espacial aparece, Izaque, Wendy e Lisa continuam conversando lá.<br />
Manuh, Kendra, Drag, Ted, Monika e John se teleportam de volta para suas espaçonaves.<br />
"Não demora muito Stake", diz Manuh.<br />
Depois de algum tempo, Izaque, Wendy e Lisa se teletransportaram de volta para suas espaçonaves, Izaque e Wendy conversaram um pouco sobre o aniversário.<br />
"Foi bom né?", diz Wendy.<br />
"Sim, foi muito legal ver todo mundo e tudo mais", diz Izaque.<br />
Izaque estava um pouco cansado, assistiu a um episódio da segunda temporada de One Punch Man e deitou em sua cama.<br />
Ele dormiu.<br />
Wendy estava praticando em seu teclado, ela achou que aprendeu muito desde a última vez que tocou.<br />
Manuh já estava dormindo, Kendra estava dormindo também, ela estava sonhando com No Man's Sky, ou um mundo Synthwave.<br />
Drag estava ouvindo um pouco de kpop em seu celular.<br />
Lisa estava escrevendo um pouco, The Odds Of Nature novamente ("Ela adora escrever essa história", diz o *Escritor*).<br />
Ted e Monika assistiam a um filme de romance, adoravam assistir juntos.<br />
John estava terminando o mais novo capítulo de uma de suas histórias [Eu também, ah, para de quebrar a quarta parede...].<br />
Todos estavam felizes na SpaceLiving Network, vivendo suas vidas, fazendo suas coisas, fazendo o que amam.<br />
Foi um bom dia para a SpaceLiving."<br /><br />

Capitulo 8<br />
---<br />
Era um dia lindo no mundo da SpaceLiving.<br />
Lisa, Izaque, Wendy, John, Ted, Monika, Manuh, Kendra e Drag estavam todos dentro de suas naves espaciais, vivendo felizes.<br />
Izaque estava procurando por "coisas do New World" na Internet e servidores de Discord.<br />
Ele era um SpaceLiver ou um residente das LonelyShips, mas também gostava de fazer "coisas do New World" na Terra.<br />
Izaque aprendeu sobre essa Teoria do New World em 2016, era sobre um grupo de pessoas que estavam mudando o mundo todo.<br />
Com hologramas, formas corporais parecidas com almas, seres, leis, ele fez a documentação do New World e um site para ele em 2019, antes de ser teleportado para uma LonelyShip.<br />
E, às vezes, ele se teletransporta para fora de sua espaçonave, para fazer essas coisas do New World, para usar hologramas, para ver seus amados personagens de seu desenho favorito.<br />
Que é My Little Pony: A amizade é mágica, Izaque sonhou toda a sua vida sobre ser capaz de vê-las, abraçá-las, conversar com elas.<br />
A primeira vez que as viu, com a possibilidade que o New World criou para ele, foi dois meses antes de ser teleportado para a sua LonelyShip, ele abraçou cada uma delas.<br />
Twilight Sparkle, Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, Rarity e Applejack.<br />
Ele estava tão feliz naquele momento que podia chorar de felicidade o dia todo.<br />
O New World e o Governo do New World criaram um portal para todas as coisas visuais que os humanos criaram, filmes, desenhos animados, animes, jogos, séries.<br />
Izaque adorava visitar e conversar com todos os seus personagens favoritos, MLP, Sword Art Online, Fairy Tail, To Love Ru, Shingeki No Kyojin, Yuru Camp, Plastic Memories, Eromanga Sensei.<br />
Ele tinha muitos amigos do New World, que conheciam a tecnologia do New World.<br />
Izaque estava cansado, ele disse para alguns amigos do Discord que ele ia tirar um cochilo, ele olhou para o relógio do computador e percebeu que eram 12h da tarde.<br />
Ele disse boa tarde a Wendy, Lulu, Igor, Carol, Paulo, Camila e Natália, depois desligou o computador e deitou na cama.<br />
Izaque estava sonhando, ele era uma criança nesse sonho, um garoto chamado Izaque, e ele estava jantando com Lulu, sua irmã, Ana, sua mãe, John, seu pai.<br />
Ele amava sua família, Izaque adorava sair em aventuras com Lulu e John, em uma aventura específica, Izaque ganhou uma luva de ouro com jóias, ele acha que o último usuário dessa luva foi sonahT.<br />
Izaque adorava usar sua luva, para proteger sua família, a luva tinha o poder de criar portais, de viajar para outra dimensão e de disparar elementos.<br />
Uma noite, todos, exceto Izaque, estavam dormindo, ele pegou a luva e saiu de casa, depois abriu um portal para o mundo de My Little Pony.<br />
Foi sua primeira vez em outro mundo, ele transformou sua luva em duas luvas pretas normais e se fez invisível.<br />
Ele olhou e analisou as criaturas daquele mundo, eles eram pôneis, então Izaque se imaginou como um pônei, ele se transformou em um com uma juba verde, pele azul e ficou visível.<br />
Um pônei rosa se aproximou dele, ele estava com medo, porque ele não queria chamar muita atenção ou fazer uma comoção.<br />
O pônei rosa disse em uma voz aguda e estridente: "Eu nunca vi você aqui em Ponyville, você é novo?, <br />
meu nome é Pinkie Pie e eu sou a recepcionista, organizadora de festas e cozinheira de cupcakes da cidade, qual é o seu nome?"<br />
Izaque estava assustado e surpreso sobre como aquele pônei podia falar tão rápido, que era difícil para ele entender todas aquelas palavras em tão pouco tempo.<br />
Ele respondeu: "Uh... meu nome é Izaque e sim, eu sou novo aqui, eu não quero viver aqui, você sabe... eu sou apenas um visitante, posso falar com...".<br />
Naquele momento, Izaque levou o casco direito para as costas e usou a luva escondida para conhecer um pouco do universo.<br />
Parecia que ele estava roubando ou copiando o conhecimento que o Izaque do Planeta Terra tinha em 2019 sobre o universo de My Little Pony.<br />
"Twilight Sparkle?", Disse ele, terminando a frase.<br />
Pinkie Pie disse: "Ah, você quer conhecer minha amiga Twlight, certo? Eu vou levar você até ela".<br />
"Muito obrigado!", Respondeu Izaque.<br />
Os dois caminharam até o Castelo da Amizade e Pinkie Pie bateu na porta.<br />
Twlight abriu a porta e disse: "Oh olá Pinkie Pie", em seguida, virou a cabeça para Izaque e disse enquanto chegava perto de seu rosto:<br />
"Ei... eu acho que te conheço, você tem uma aura de alguém que eu conheço... posso te olhar mais de perto?"<br />
Izaque corou e disse: "B-bem, talvez, hehe...".<br />
Pinkie Pie disse: "Bem... eu vou deixar vocês sozinhos", e começou a se afastar deles.<br />
"Que bom!", Disse Twlight.<br />
Então ela começou a murmurar enquanto o analisava: "Você me lembra do Izaque... um humano que vem aqui às vezes", disse ela.<br />
"Eu temo que você seja uma versão dele de outro universo, o que você está fazendo aqui, e por que você é um pônei? Como você chegou aqui?".<br />
Izaque disse: "Bem... eu só queria visitar este mundo, eu sou um pônei porque eu tenho um item mágico, eu cheguei aqui pelo mesmo item mágico".<br />
Então ele pensou consigo mesmo: "Cara, eu tenho que voltar, eu aprendi através do Izaque de 2019 que um dia neste mundo é um ano no meu mundo, espero que isso seja um mito".<br />
Twlight disse: "Oh... e que item mágico é esse?".<br />
"Posso entrar? Não posso mostrar isso em público", sussurrou Izaque.<br />
Twlight disse: "Claro!, entre", Izaque entrou e Twilight fechou a porta.<br />
"É essa coisa aqui", disse Izaque, enquanto transformava sua luva de volta ao seu estado original.<br />
Os olhos de Twlight brilharam quando ela viu a bela e brilhante luva de ouro com jóias, ela queria tocá-lo.<br />
Ela moveu o casco para perto da luva, Izaque moveu a luva para perto dele e disse: "Eu tenho que ir Twlight, desculpe, eu vou deixar esta pedra aqui, então você pode lembrar que eu vou voltar".<br />
"Oh, tudo bem...", disse Twlight, então Izaque criou uma pequena pedra com a letra "I" nela e a jogou no chão, abriu um portal de volta ao seu mundo e atravessou-o.<br />
Ele estava de volta ao seu mundo, ele entrou na casa e caminhou até seu quarto, guardou a luva em um baú de madeira e dormiu novamente.<br />
Antes de dormir, Izaque pensou: "Eu disse que iria viajar para outros mundos, Lulu do Planeta Terra!".<br />
Então o sonho de Izaque mudou para outra coisa, ele estava sonhando com um jogo chamado No Man's Sky.<br />
Wendy estava em sua nave espacial, ela percebeu que ela amava o pássaro Fênix, e queria ter um, ela se perguntou se ela poderia criar um na nave espacial.<br />
Então uma voz começou a falar na espaçonave, dizia: "Você quer ter um animal de estimação em sua espaçonave?, então clique neste botão e o menu Animais de estimação abrirá no seu computador".<br />
"Se você tivesse um animal de estimação na terra, seria trazido junto com você, mas parece que você não tem um, então pegue um no menu".<br />
Wendy apertou o botão e o menu abriu no aplicativo SpaceLiving que foi instalado em seu computador, ela então selecionou o Fênix.<br />
O menu permite que ela escolha apenas o nome do animal de estimação, ela escolheu um e clicou no botão "Spawn".<br />
Um Fênix apareceu em sua nave espacial, o animal era uma fêmea, seu nome era "Philomena".<br />
O pássaro era um pássaro feio, Wendy não gostou disso, mas depois o pássaro explodiu em chamas e se transformou em cinzas.<br />
Depois de algum tempo, as cinzas brilham e um lindo pássaro amarelo e vermelho nasce, brilhando mais que o sol, Wendy ficou impressionada com isso.<br />
Philomena voou para o braço de Wendy e sorriu: "Eu te amo... Philomena...", disse Wendy.<br />
Então, depois de algum tempo, uma gaiola aberta e um ninho apareceram na parede, tinha comida de pássaros e água, uma voz na espaçonave disse:<br />
"A espaçonave detecta automaticamente se o animal precisa de comida ou água, se o animal bebe ou come toda a comida, a nave espacial vai colocar mais lá dentro".<br />
"E a espaçonave tem um lugar especial para cada tipo de animal, para que eles possam fazer suas necessidades, toda vez que o animal pensar em fazer isso, a espaçonave vai liberar um cheiro".<br />
"Um perfume que faz o animal querer ir a esse lugar especial, seu animal de estimação estará em boas mãos, ou mais como... braços e pistões mecânicos, obrigado por ter um animal de estimação, cuide bem dele!".<br />
Wendy estava um pouco cansada, ela tocava piano, Philomena dançava com a música que estava tocando, Wendy estava feliz com isso.<br />
Ela se cansou e deitou em sua cama, dormiu e teve um bom sonho, um sonho feliz, onde estava com seus amigos e tinha Philomena com ela.<br />
Izaque ainda estava sonhando com No Man's Sky, ele estava conversando com um amigo dele, um Korvax.<br />
John estava escrevendo uma de suas histórias em seu computador, ele queria terminar esse capítulo rapidamente porque estava com sono e cansado.<br />
Ele terminou o capítulo e enviou para Lisa, ela gostou do capítulo e disse a ele para postar, ele postou e recebeu muitos comentários.<br />
John estava cansado demais para responder a todos eles, comeu duas bolachas de chocolate e bebeu um copo de água, depois deitou-se na cama e dormiu.<br />
Todos na SpaceLiving estavam dormindo, eram 23:00 lá, Ted dormia junto com Monika.<br />
Eles sempre dormem abraçados, Ted estava sonhando em ser o personagem do jogo de sobrevivência Don't Starve, o personagem era Wilson.<br />
Ele andou um pouco na pastagem, juntou algumas ervas e gravetos e fez uma fogueira com pedras.<br />
Depois disso, ele derrubou algumas árvores, colocou cinco toras na fogueira, cozinhou carne de porco e comeu.<br />
Então ele andou um pouco longe para verificar algumas armadilhas que ele tinha feito para pegar alguns coelhos, três deles tinham coelhos presos dentro deles.<br />
John pegou as armadilhas e matou todos os coelhos, em seguida, caminhou de volta para sua fogueira e cozinhou os três coelhos e os guardou em sua geladeira.<br />
Monika estava sonhando em ser um arquivo de computador, ela estava dentro de um jogo, naquele jogo, havia cinco personagens, ela, Sayori, Yuri, Natsuki e Izaque, ou o personagem principal.<br />
Ela pensou que o sonho era realmente estranho, parecia muito real, ela sabia que era um jogo.<br />
Um vídeo estava se tornando famoso na Internet, era um vídeo que Izaque postou, ele gravou sua LonelyShip e fez um tour através dela.<br />
Ele mostrou seu poderoso computador, sua ThoughtPoweredFridge(TPF), como funcionava, como os botões da espaçonave funcionavam, o que as janelas mostravam.<br />
Izaque disse que era uma linda espaçonave, com paredes brancas, ele disse que adorava morar lá com Manuh, Drag e Kendra.<br />
Lisa estava ouvindo algumas músicas de synth-pop que ela tinha baixado, ela queria falar um pouco com Izaque.<br />
Izaque acordou, ele precisava de um café, saiu da cama e abriu a geladeira, sua linda taça verde quadrangular estava lá, com um pouco de café com leite.<br />
Estava quente, e o cheiro era incrível, a cor, 20% de leite e 80% de café, o leite era servido primeiro, como ele gostava.<br />
Ele certamente amava aquele copo, era sua xícara favorita na terra, depois ligou o computador e tocou o que estava ouvindo da última vez que usou o computador.<br />
Era uma música rock, o volume era tão alto que ele derramou café na mesa e no chão, "Merda!", Gritou ele.<br />
Ele parou a música rapidamente, deixou a xícara sobre a mesa e pegou um guardanapo para limpar a mesa, depois limpou a mesa e trocou de roupa.<br />
Izaque ouviu uma música calma enquanto bebia seu café e checava sua mídia social, o nome da música era "<a href="https://soundcloud.com/officialpandaeyes/panda-eyes-take-my-hand-ft-azuria-sky-zne-remix">Panda Eyes - Take My Hand Ft. Azuria Sky (Z∆NE Remix)</a>".<br />
Algumas pessoas gostaram e comentaram sobre suas histórias no Wattpad, ele respondeu a todas elas, agradecendo aos fãs, depois respondeu às suas mensagens no Facebook e no Discord.<br />
Ele adorava saber que Wendy, Lulu, Paulo e Igor tinham conversado com ele, ele estava tão feliz em vê-los todos os dias, mesmo que não fosse fisicamente.<br />
Para ele, era incrível ver seus rostos ou fotos de perfil todos os dias.<br />
Kendra acordou e queria comer algo doce, levantou-se e pegou um marshmallow que estava dentro da geladeira.<br />
Ela comeu e adorou, então ela queria ouvir um pouco de rock em seu computador, ela colocou para tocar.<br />
Kendra era igual a Izaque, headbangando como se estivesse headbangando para Dubstep.<br />
Manuh e Drag ainda estavam dormindo, eles estavam sonhando com um monte de coisas, Drag sonhava em visitar alguns artistas de k-pop.<br />
Então, sobre jogar um jogo em seu smartphone, Free Fire, ele gostava de jogar esse jogo.<br />
Manuh sonhava em morar com Brendon Urie da banda Panic! na discoteca, ela o amava.<br />
Wendy sonhava em tocar piano, pensou em um bom vídeo que viu um dia, sobre um cover de Bad Guy de Billie Eilish.<br />
Ela gostou desse vídeo, enviou-o para um amigo especial dela, seu amigo gostou do vídeo e agradeceu.<br />
Monika estava sonhando em viver no mundo de No Man's Sky, esses SpaceLivers (LonelyShippers) certamente sonham não? (informal: mano os cara não para de sonhar kkkk)<br /><br />

Capítulo 9 - PequeLiving, SpaceNata?<br />
---<br />
(Essa história é a parte 2 dessa aqui: <a href="https://diario.netlify.com/pequenata/26">https://diario.netlify.com/pequenata/26</a> )<br />
"Lisa estava sentada em sua cadeira enquanto olhava para a tela do computador, uma notificação chamou sua atenção.<br />
Alguém pediu para adicioná-la como amiga no Discord, era alguém chamado Pequenata, ela parecia fofa na foto, Lisa aceitou o pedido de amizade.<br />
Eles começaram a conversar:<br />
Lisa: "Olá... você me adicionou do servidor SpaceLiving, certo?"<br />
Pequenata: "Sim... eu conheci algumas pessoas legais lá, e eu pensei que você parecia legal e gentil xD, estou te irritando de alguma forma?".<br />
Lisa: "Claro que não! Eu adoro falar com novas pessoas ^^, você é uma SpaceLiver certo?, ou uma LonelyShipper".<br />
Pequenata: "Sim, eu acho que poderia ser chamada desse jeito xD, eu estava apenas descendo o Facebook no meu computador e comecei a flutuar e uma luz azul clara rodeava meu corpo, eu não sabia o que estava acontecendo, eu estava com muito medo...".<br />
Lisa: "Ah... esse é um dos rumores que eu tenho ouvido, acho que foi chamado de Teleporte Aleatório, não é o procedimento padrão para teletransportar alguém para uma Nave Espacial, eu sinto muito por você...".<br />
Pequenata: "Hm, obrigado por explicar isso para mim, eu já comi uma fatia de pizza e assisti a um anime chamado Eromanga Sensei, isso é o suficiente para ser considerado um SpaceLiver? xD".<br />
Lisa: "Talvez xD, na verdade, para ser considerado um SpaceLiver você tem que ser teletransportado para uma nave espacial, há um monte de coisas legais para fazer".<br />
Lisa: "E... Eromanga Sensei?, eu amo esse anime!, na verdade eu pareço um pouco com a personagem principal, Sagiri, aqui... eu vou mandar uma foto minha...".<br />
<a href="img/lisa.jpg"><img src="img/lisa.jpg" width="10%" style="float:left;border-width:4px;border-color:#2196F3;border-style:solid;" /></a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
Pequenata: "Oh... você é fofa xD, e você parece com ela!: 3, eu vou enviar uma foto minha... não olhe muito, eu sou tímidoa...: 3".<br />
(Narrador-Izaque: Júlia vai ficar brava Pequenata... não mande fotos pra ela xD)<br />
<a href="img/pequenata.jpg"><img src="img/pequenata.jpg" width="10%" style="float:left;border-width:4px;border-color:#2196F3;border-style:solid;" /></a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
Lisa: "V-Você é fofa também! :3, hehe, eu gosto do seu cabelo, eu queria ter essa cor, e... está chovendo onde sua nave está localizada?, eu nunca vi uma nuvem perto da minha nave antes, isso é estranho... ".<br />
Pequenata: "Sério?, Não há nuvens aqui, como as nuvens podem existir aqui se estamos vivendo no espaço xD".<br />
Lisa: "Eu não sei xD, hey, você quer conhecer alguns dos meus amigos?"<br />
Pequenata: "Um... claro, se eles são tão legais quanto você xD".<br />
Lisa: "Bem, aqui está a tag do Discord do meu amigo Izaque, ele é muito legal, e, você quer ler minhas histórias?, Izaque escreve também xD".<br />
Pequenata: "Eu vou adicioná-lo, envie-me o link ou arquivo que você gostaria que eu lesse, eu adoraria ler algo feito por você".<br />
Então Pequenata pediu o pedido de amizade de Izaque e abriu a página de história chamada "The Odds of Nature", a história que Lisa lhe enviara.<br />
Pequenata começou a conversar com Izaque:<br />
Pequenata: "Olá Izaque... Lisa me enviou sua tag do Discord, então eu adicionei você aqui, obrigado por aceitar o pedido de amizade, então... você escreve histórias? UwU".<br />
Izaque: "Bem, estou te escrevendo agora... Quero dizer, estou escrevendo algo agora, mas você pode falar comigo :3, eu acho que Lisa não me disse que você ia me adicionar".<br />
Pequenata: "Talvez você precise falar com ela sobre isso, e, o que você ta escrevendo? Eu tava assistindo Eromanga Sensei, eu disse isso pra Lisa e ela me disse que ela se parece com a personagem principal, Sagiri".<br />
Pequenata: "Ela me enviou uma foto dela... ela é muito fofa, mas você já sabe disso né? Vocês parecem ser amigos muito próximos...".<br />
Izaque: "Sim, bem, na verdade, ela nunca me enviou uma foto dela '-'... Vou pedir para ela me enviar uma foto xD".<br />
Pequenata: "Isso é estranho xD... mas provavelmente ela irá enviar um para você, e-eu...".<br />
Izaque: "O que?, eu não vou te julgar... não precisa se preocupar".<br />
Pequenata: "Não é isso... quer dizer, eu fui teletransportada para cá por engano, eu tava apenas cuidando da minha vida no meu computador e comecei a flutuar e uma luz azul me cercou, então eu fui levada para essa espaçonave".<br />
Izaque: "Então os rumores eram verdadeiros... o Teleporte Aleatório, bem, eles disseram que você pode voltar, certo? Pelo menos é o que o boato fala...".<br />
Pequenata: "Sim, eles falaram que eu poderia clicar com o botão direito do mouse no ícone da bandeja e selecionar [Teleportar de volta para a Terra], talvez seja uma falha ou algo assim, e o sistema chamou a pessoa errada?".<br />
Izaque: "Sim, eu acho que é isso, você já tentou clicar nesse botão? Provavelmente eles vão pedir uma confirmação, não se preocupe".<br />
Depois disso, Pequenata clicou com o botão direito do mouse no ícone da bandeja e selecionou [Teleportar de volta para a Terra], uma mensagem solicitou sua confirmação dizendo "Você realmente quer se teletransportar de volta à Terra?".<br />
Pequenata voltou à janela do Discord e mandou uma mensagem para Izaque dizendo:<br />
"Sim... tu ta certo, parece que funciona, e me pediu uma confirmação...".<br />
Izaque: "Oh, isso é legal, espero que você possa voltar à Terra se realmente quiser, posso te enviar uma de minhas histórias?"<br />
Pequenata: "Sim!, adoraria ler algo feito por você ❤️... ".<br />
Izaque: "Ok, vou enviar, e vou te adicionar à lista de Leitores :3".<br />
Então Izaque enviou a Pequenata um link para sua história, Clone Network.<br />
Pequenata: "Estou muito feliz por estar nessa lista! :3".<br />
Izaque: "Obrigado pelo amor e apoio Pequenata, to muito feliz por te conhecer :3 ❤️".<br />
Pequenata: "Eu acho que vou terminar de ler um capítulo da Odds Of Nature e Clone Network, obrigado por me enviar o link".<br />
Izaque: "Ah, a história da Lisa xD, ela tem muito talento pra escrever".<br />
Pequenata: "Eu concordo com você, me faz sentir dentro da história".<br />
Izaque: "Eu sinto o mesmo xD, eu acho que vou assistir alguma coisa da minha lista Para Assistir, Pequenata, posso te perguntar uma coisa?".<br />
Pequenata: "Sim?..."<br />
Izaque: "P-Pode me enviar uma foto sua?...".<br />
Izaque: "Desculpa, eu não devia ter perguntado isso...".<br />
Pequenata: "Ok, aqui está, é a mesma que eu enviei pra Lisa".<br />
<a href="img/pequenata.jpg"><img src="img/pequenata.jpg" width="10%" style="float:left;border-width:4px;border-color:#2196F3;border-style:solid;" /></a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
Izaque: "Sério?... você é muito fofa! :3... hehe, você tem olhos lindos...".<br />
Pequenata: "Obrigado Izaque! :3 ^w^, você pode mandar uma sua também?, to tímida e envergonhada agora...".<br />
Izaque: "Oh, foi mal, eu esqueci!"<br />
(Bem, acho que eu não posso colocar essa foto aqui xD, leitor, eu sou tímido, desculpa, por favor peça minha tag do Discord no meu perfil do Twitter que você pode achar <a href="https://diario.netlify.com/pages/eu/">nesse link</a> se você realmente quiser ver meu rosto)<br />
Pequenata: "Você é tão fofooooo! :3, eu estou corando muito agora, desculpa".<br />
Izaque: "Ta tudo bem xD, obrigado, você também é fofa Littletato, quero dizer, Pequenata".<br />
Pequenata: "Como você sabe esse nome?, algumas pessoas me chamam de Littletato aqui em São Francisco, na verdade, *lá* em São Francisco, eu não sei porque, talvez seja a versão americana do nome...".<br />
Izaque: "Eu não sabia disso, quero dizer, ah... eu não consigo explicar... desculpa".<br />
Pequenata: "Ta tudo bem... eu vou ler alguma coisa, ok?, desculpa se eu não responder muito rápido :3".<br />
Izaque: "Ok :3, to um pouco ocupado aqui também xD".<br />
Pequenata então começou a ler The Odds Of Nature, ela leu a história até o quinto capítulo e parou.<br />
Depois disso, ela leu Clone Network e gostou, ela queria dizer isso para Izaque e Lisa.<br />
Pequenata abriu a conversa com Izaque e disse:<br />
"Olá... amei sua história Izaque!, gostei de como você vai fazendo muitos clones para fazer tudo o que você quer, é um pensamento muito bom e uma idéia incrível xD".<br />
Izaque: "Oh, valeu pelo feedback Pequenata :3, to feliz que você tenha gostado, porque com certeza adorei escrever essa história...".<br />
Izaque: "Além disso, você pode me prometer algo Nata?"<br />
Pequenata: "Nata, gostei desse nome xD, o que é?".<br />
Izaque: "Você pode me prometer que me dirá quando começar a se teletransportar de volta à Terra?"<br />
Pequenata: "Sim... eu vou ter certeza de te dizer, eu prometo :3".<br />
Izaque: "Obrigado...".<br />
Pequenata: "De nada, meu querido amigo".<br />
Então Izaque abriu sua conversa com Lisa para perguntar algo:<br />
"Ei, Lisa...".<br />
Lisa: "Oie Izaque!, como você ta? :3".<br />
Izaque: "Bom, eu to bem, você enviou minha tag do Discord pra Pequenata sem me perguntar?"<br />
Lisa: "Uh... sim... desculpa Izaque, eu vou pedir sua permissão na próxima vez, desculpa...".<br />
Izaque: "Tudo bem, eu não to bravo com você :3, mas... Pequenata disse que você mandou uma foto para ela, e você nunca mandou uma foto para mim '-'...".<br />
Lisa: "Aww meu amor... eu não mandei porque você não pediu... aqui, eu vou mandar um para você, e... você nunca me mandou uma foto também xD".<br />
Izaque: "Desculpa, vou enviar xD".<br />
<a href="img/lisa.jpg"><img src="img/lisa.jpg" width="10%" style="float:left;border-width:4px;border-color:#2196F3;border-style:solid;" /></a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
(novamente, não posso mostrar meu rosto aqui xD)<br />
Izaque: "Você é tão fofaaaaaaa Lisa! :3, eu amo seus olhos verdes e seu lindo cabelo grisalho :3".<br />
Lisa: "Você é tão fofo também meu amor! :3, eu amo seu cabelo fofo e seu rosto fofo, seu nariz é fofo também :3 xD".<br />
Izaque: "Obrigado Lisa xD, to vermelho agora, obrigado por tanto amor ❤️".<br />
Lisa: "De nada, meu amor!"<br />
...<br />
Pequenata estava preocupada com Júlia, ela abriu o menu para se teletransportar de volta à Terra, quando estava pronta para clicar no botão "Sim!", Pensou em Izaque e Lisa, seus dois queridos amigas.<br />
Ela pensou em dizer-lhes adeus.<br />
(Ouça essa música e leia esta parte enquanto a escuta: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/officialpandaeyes/oppositeside">https://soundcloud.com/officialpandaeyes/oppositeside</a> )<br />
Pequenata abriu a conversa de Izaque e disse.<br />
"Olá Izaque, to voltando pra Terra agora, foi bom e divertido conhecer você, eu fui feliz, talvez nos vejamos novamente em breve... Espero que você tenha um bom dia, ou... noite xD :3".<br />
Izaque: "Foi divertido conhecer e conversar com você também Pequenata, eu definitivamente vou escrever sobre você mais, quero dizer, nós definitivamente nos veremos novamente, talvez no capítulo 50 de Pequenata, quero dizer, talvez em breve! :3".<br />
Izaque: "Adeus Pequenata! :3".<br />
Pequenata: "Adeus Izaque! :3 :)".<br />
Então ela falou com Lisa:<br />
"Olá Lisa, to voltando pra terra!, espero que nos vejamos novamente em breve, fiquei feliz ao conversar com você mesmo que fosse só por um dia, obrigada por isso Lisa!".<br />
Lisa: "Oh, você ta indo agora :), adeus Pequenata, tenho certeza que nos veremos novamente, eu também fiquei feliz com você! :3, obrigada! :33".<br />
Pequenata: "Tee hee! Obrigado Lisa, adeus :3"."<br /><br />

Capítulo 10 - Marina entra na sala<br />
---<br />
Wendy estava tocando teclado em sua espaçonave, era a música tema do filme Titanic, ela gostava de praticar mais teclado.<br />
Izaque estava pensando sobre seus dias na escola, ele tinha muitos amigos lá e gostava de conversar com eles todos os dias, a comida não era muito boa, mas ele gostava.<br />
Monika estava conversando com algumas de suas amigas no Discord, uma amiga dela se chamava Sayori.<br />
Monika disse: "ei Sayori, como você está?..."<br />
Sayori: "Ei Monika, eu to bem, e você?"<br />
Monika: "Eu também to bem, só morando aqui na espaçonave com meu namorado Ted"<br />
Sayori: "Ah, eu tenho um emprego de meio período com Yuri, é em uma biblioteca"<br />
Monika: "Isso parece muito bom Sayori, boa sorte no seu trabalho! E quanto a Yuri?"<br />
Sayori: "Bem... ela gostou do trabalho porque adora livros, então eu acho que é um bom trabalho para ela"<br />
Ted estava jogando Titanfall 2 com seus amigos, depois mudou para Terraria.<br />
Izaque recebeu uma notificação no servidor Discord do SpaceLiving dizendo que um novo SpaceLiver chegou.<br />
A mensagem diz: "@Funkysnipa Cat#XXXX Olá, um novo SpaceLiver chegou!, seria bom se você pudesse cumprimentá-lo e explicar-lhe sobre a Rede SpaceLiving, obrigado pela sua ajuda! :)"<br />
Izaque então adicionou o novo SpaceLiver no Discord, ela se chamava Marina.<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Olá, eu sou um administrador no servidor do Discord da SpaceLiving, eles me disseram que você é nova aqui, então... precisa de ajuda com algo? :)"<br />
Peach_Army: "Queria saber onde estou, de onde veio tudo isso e de quem é esse coelho?"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Bom... essa nave se chama "LonelyShip", ela está planando a alguns quilômetros da terra, se você olhar pela janela vai poder ver a terra."<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Esse coelho foi dado a você por que você teve um pensamento antes de vir para cá, sobre ter um coelho, e então a nave o deu para você."<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Não se preocupe, se quiser voltar para sua casa pode ir no ícone em seu computador e clicar em "Teletransportar de volta para a terra..."."<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "A nave te teleportou para ela por que ela sentiu seu desejo, sobre viver sozinha, só com um computador, comida, um banheiro, isso aconteceu comigo também, e com todos nós do servidor."<br />
Marina olhou para a janela e pensou um pouco sobre a Terra, sobre tudo o que passou por lá, depois decidiu algo, foi até o computador e digitou nas teclas brilhantes.<br />
Peach_Army: "Quero ficar."<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Hm, fico feliz por você, eu posso te assegurar que vai ser muito feliz aqui, espero que eu tenha te ajudado, podemos ser amigos?... meu nome é Izaque."<br />
Peach_Army: "Bom, já que provavelmente vou ficar sozinha aqui com... o coelho, então podemos ser amigos sim."<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Que bom, fico feliz, qual é seu nome?"<br />
Peach_Army: "Meu nome é Marina, muito prazer"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Muito prazer Marina."<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Então... o que gosta de fazer no computador? :D"<br />
Marina: "tento compor musicas, jogo alguns jogos de estrategia e converso"<br />
Marina: "também vejo doramas"<br />
Marina: "e estudo"<br />
Marina: "E você?"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Bom, eu assisto animes, escrevo algumas histórias, converso com amigos daqui, ajudo as pessoas novas que chegam, adoro jogar também, no Xbox One, PS4"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "e estudar era uma das coisas chatas que eu fazia na minha vida na terra xD, por que você estuda?, ou o que você estuda?"<br />
Marina: "Na verdade, estudar era uma das coisas que eu mais gostava na Terra"<br />
Marina: "Gosto de saber que o que eu aprendo sempre vai se inovar"<br />
Marina: "devo ter sido uma das únicas pessoas que gosta de matemática"<br />
Marina: "xD"<br />
Marina: "E eu estudo bastante a cultura asiática"<br />
Marina: "Principalmente a coreana"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "kkkk, acho que posso largar o "primeira letra maiúscula" e usar ponto final, eles dizem que eu não posso fazer amizade com as pessoas que ajudo a chegarem na SpaceLiving"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "acho que eu só não gostava de aprender o que eu não ia usar como história, português, ou as coisas da escola, mas adoro aprender sobre tecnologia"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "amo a cultura japonesa"<br />
Marina: "Uma das minhas favoritas também kkkk"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "kkkk"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "adoro mostrar esse mundo novo pras pessoas, por que amo viver nele, o SpaceLiving, mas não gosto muito das regras, tipo da qual eu te falei"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "sabe o nome da empresa que criou a Rede SpaceLiving?"<br />
Marina: "não..."<br />
Marina: "qual?"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "é a ThinkOutsideTheBox ou TOTB"<br />
Marina: "Como ficam as famílias das pessoas do SpaceLiving?"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "acho que elas ficam tristes, mas algumas nem ligam, por que não se importam com o parente, eles recebem uma notícia tipo um holograma, dizendo que o parente delas está em uma SpaceLiving"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "você pode comer o que quiser na geladeira, mas seus parentes e amigos podem mandar comidas especiais pra você se eles quiserem, só avisar eles"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "como uma comida que você adora da sua vó ou da sua mãe"<br />
Marina: "entendo..."<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "tem também um teleportador na nave que pode teleportar você para uma casa que você considera confiável como a casa de seus pais, pra visitar eles se sentir saudade"<br />
Marina: "eu ia perguntar isso agora kkkk"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "kkkk"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "só ir lá e pensar "casa do meu pai" "casa da minha mãe" ou algo parecido, e clicar em um botão chamado "Enviar""<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "a pessoa que mora na casa que você escolheu vai receber a notificação e vai escolher aceitar ou não, ai um teleportador vai ser criado na casa escolhida"<br />
Marina: "entendi.."<br />
Marina: "acho que vou gostar mesmo daqui"<br />
Marina: "parece que meu sonho finalmente se realizou, sem os problemas dos outros me cercando"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "isso é muito bom Marina, o meu sonho também era esse, e viver sozinho também, amo computadores"<br />
Marina: "meu computador me criou kkkkk"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "kkkkk"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "acho que tem um menino que escreve histórias sobre essa nave"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "ou a nave dele no caso, talvez esse menino seja eu kkkkk, só talvez..."<br />
Marina: "serio?!"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "sim kksssk"<br />
Marina: "gostaria muito de ler sua historia um dia"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "eu adoraria te mandar ela"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "já tem alguns capítulos publicados"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "quer o link?"<br />
Marina: "sim, por favor"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "<a href="https://diario.netlify.com/new_world/spaceliving/">https://diario.netlify.com/new_world/spaceliving/</a>"<br />
Marina: "obrigado"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "de nada, obrigado por ler"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "acho que no capítulo 5 tem o convite para o servidor da SpaceLiving, mas isso é meio inútil já que você já ta nele"<br />
Marina: "então, quem chega no capitulo 5, e esta na terra, pode ir para o SpaceLiving?!"<br />
Marina: "se eu soubesse teria lido sua historia antes kkkkkkkkkk"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "kkkkkk"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "bom... não, só mando essa história para quem já está em uma nave"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "mas acho que tem alguns tutoriais na internet sobre como ser "chamado" para viver em uma SpaceLiving"<br />
Marina: "nunca havia visto nada sobre isso"<br />
Marina: "eu teria gostado muito"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "eu também"<br />
Marina: "Eu vou falar com você mais tarde, vou assistir um anime aqui, te vejo mais tarde :3"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Até mais, Marina :3"<br />
Então Marina caminhou perto de sua geladeira e pensou em uma coca-cola e uma fatia de pizza.<br />
Ela se sentou em sua cadeira e colocou a xícara e o prato no topo da mesa, então baixou um episódio do anime chamado Eromanga Sensei para assistir.<br />
Marina comeu a comida e bebeu o refrigerante enquanto assistia, ela adorava assistir anime enquanto comia.<br />
Depois disso, ela estava se sentindo um pouco cansada, ela disse boa noite para Izaque e deitou em sua cama, então dormiu.<br /><br />
<hr class="slhr" />

Capítulo 11 - A visita de Izaque<br />
---<br />
Izaque estava em sua LonelyShip, estava ouvindo uma música do gênero Dubstep em Foobar2000, pensou em Marina, sua amiga especial.<br />
Ele queria visitá-la de alguma forma ou se teletransportar para a LonelyShip dela, ele enviou uma mensagem para ela no Discord, dizendo:<br />
"Ei Marina, posso me teletransportar para sua nave espacial?... eu queria te visitar".<br />
Ela respondeu positivamente, depois ele abriu o Painel SpaceLiving em seu computador.<br />
Um botão apareceu e dizia:<br />
"Teleporte para...".<br />
Então ele clicou e digitou o ID do Discord de Marina junto com o nome dela.<br />
Uma mensagem apareceu no computador de Marina, dizendo:<br />
"O Funkysnipa Cat#XXXX quer se teletransportar para a sua LonelyShip, aceita?".<br />
Ela clicou em sim, então o teleportador de Izaque começou a brilhar em azul, ele entrou e fechou a porta.<br />
Uma luz azul brilha dentro do teleportador de Marina, depois que ela some Marina vê Izaque dentro dele.<br />
Ele sai de dentro dele e diz:<br />
"Oie Marina!", diz Izaque.<br />
"Oi!", diz Marina.<br />
"Então... acho que faz tempo que eu não vejo uma pessoa... pessoalmente", diz Izaque dando uma risada curta.<br />
"Sim", diz Marina com uma risada curta.<br />
"Posso sentar na sua cama?", pergunta Izaque.<br />
"Pode sim", diz ela batendo na parte da cama ao seu lado, indicando que ele deveria se sentar lá.<br />
Ele senta na cama dela e percebe que a colcha da cama é roxa e muito bonita, ele começa olhar a espaçonave de Marina.<br />
Ela continua á mexer em seu notebook.<br />
Ele olha Marina mexendo no notebook e tem uma ideia.<br />
"Ei Marina, quer assistir algo comigo?, tipo um anime?, a espaçonave tem um computador também se quiser, e uma tela grande", pergunta Izaque.<br />
"Pode ser... Podemos comer alguma coisa enquanto assistimos", responde Marina, que se levanta e vai ate a geladeira, escolhendo alguns doces.<br />
"Ok, obrigado", diz Izaque.<br />
"Posso ir escolhendo o filme?", pergunta Izaque.<br />
"Claro", responde Marina.<br />
"Ok", diz Izaque.<br />
Ele pega o notebook de Marina, abre a interface de SpaceLiving, ativa o computador e o monitor grande, e usa o controlador remoto para escolher um filme no computador.<br />
Ele abre o aplicativo SpaceFlix no computador, que tem todos os tipos de coisas que a humanidade já produziu, animes, filmes, séries, doramas, vídeos.<br />
"O que você quer comer?", pergunta Marina.<br />
"Hm... pizza, mas sem cebola, e uma coca cola", diz ele enquanto escolhe um dorama específico que sabe que Marina gosta, chamado Meteor Garden.<br />
Ele seleciona o primeiro episódio e deixa pausado esperando Marina pegar a comida.<br />
Ela pega o que ele pede e para ela, pega sorvete e alguns biscoitos.<br />
"Já to chegando!", diz Marina.<br />
"Ok", diz ele sorrindo para Marina.<br />
Ela coloca a pizza dele num prato e leva junto com a Coca-Cola, "Aqui", diz ela sorrindo.<br />
"Obrigado Marina", diz ele, que então pega a pizza e a coca-cola e se ajeita na cama.<br />
Ela senta ao lado dele e diz:<br />
"O que você está colocando pra gente assistir?".<br />
"Meteor Garden, acho que você gosta desse dorama né?", pergunta ele.<br />
"Amo! Obrigada!". diz ela, que sorri para ele e olha para a tela.<br />
"De nada Marina", ele sorri de volta para ela, se levanta e pega o mouse e teclado sem fio do computador.<br />
Izaque deixa o vídeo em tela cheia e aperta em tocar, depois se senta novamente na cama para assistir com Marina.<br />
Marina prestava atenção em cada detalhe das cenas enquanto tomava sorvete.<br />
Ele olhava fixamente para a tela enquanto comia seu pedaço de pizza e bebia sua coca cola.<br />
"Esta gostando?", ela sussurrou agora voltando sua atenção a Izaque.<br />
"Sim, esse dorama é muito legal, você tem bom gosto Marina", responde ele.<br />
"Obrigada", Ela sente um leve rubor nas bochechas e volta sua atenção para a tela.<br />
"De nada", Izaque sorri para Marina e volta volta sua atenção para a tela.<br />
Ele pensa como é legal poder viver em uma espaçonave SpaceLiving, e poder assistir filmes em altas resoluções enquanto come coisas deliciosas, e ele sente que fazia tempo que ele não tinha uma conexão física com alguém.<br />
Izaque termina sua pizza e sua coca-cola, o episódio já está na metade.<br />
Ela come alguns biscoitos, "Quer?", diz ela oferecendo-lhe um.<br />
"Quero", responde o mesmo pegando um biscoito e o comendo.<br />
"É legal assistir junto com você Marina, fico muito feliz", diz ele, sorrindo para ela.<br />
"Gostei da sua companhia aqui Zaq!", ela sorri de volta.<br />
"Obrigado, também gostei de te fazer companhia", responde ele.<br />
Já era o final do episódio, a latinha de coca cola de Izaque estava em cima do prato dele, e o pote de sorvete de Marina estava no chão.<br />
Izaque deixou a tela do computador de Marina na área de trabalho e se levantou, pegando seu prato e o pote de dela.<br />
"Obrigada", diz ela.<br />
"De nada, ei Marina, não sei se você sabe, mas se você colocar talheres, utensílios e pratos usados na geladeira ela se desfaz deles", diz ele, abrindo a geladeira e colocando o prato e o pote lá dentro enquanto explica.<br />
Após isso ele abre a geladeira e olha para Marina, ela vê que a geladeira está vazia.<br />
"Eu não sabia, obrigada por me dizer", diz ela, que da uma risada curta.<br />
"Então, acho que voltarei à minha nave espacial, Marina, ei...", ele diz, pensativo.<br />
"Fala", diz ela enquanto o olha atentamente.<br />
"Posso te dar um abraço antes de eu ir?", pergunta Izaque.<br />
Ela sorri e se levanta, se aproximando dele e dizendo "Pode sim".<br />
Izaque a abraça e fecha os olhos, aproveitando o momento.<br />
"Obrigada por me fazer companhia hoje, eu queria ver alguém", diz ela enquanto o abraça mais forte e depois o solta, acenando e dizendo "Até".<br />
"De nada, até", diz Izaque, que entra dentro de seu teleportador, como ele estava de convidado na espaçonave de Marina, ele só pode se teleportar de volta para sua própria espaçonave.<br />
Ele fecha a porta do teleportador e aperta em um botão azul escrito "De volta para sua espaçonave.", após alguns segundos uma luz azul surge dentro do teleportador, ele da uma última olhada para Marina e depois desaparece.<br />
Marina sorri para ele antes dele desaparecer, e fica satisfeita por ter visto Izaque.<br />
Izaque volta para seu teleportador, abre a porta e sai de dentro dele, liga seu computador e abre o Discord para conversar com Marina.<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Ei Marina... obrigado por hoje, foi muito legal, acho que vou dormir um pouco".<br />
Marina: "Sim, gostei muito de hoje. Boa noite Izaque".<br />
Então Izaque desliga seu computador, se deita em sua cama e dorme.<br />
Depois disso, ela estava se sentindo um pouco cansada, ela disse boa noite para Izaque e deitou em sua cama, então dormiu.<br /><br />
