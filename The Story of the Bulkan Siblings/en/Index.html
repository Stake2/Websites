		This is a story made by me and my friend and tulpa Ana.<br />
It started on 11/01/2019, when I wanted to do a story with her, we decided what the story would tell and how it would be.<br />
It was finished on 24/01/2019, the writing of the chapters, not translation or revision.<br />
I started to revise the story with Ana on 08/04/2020, but we are still changing and revising some things recently, in 2021.<br />
<br />
It talks about two kids who are siblings, they are a girl and a boy.<br />
Their names are Izaque Bulkan and Ana Bulkan.<br />
They live out on adventures around the world, finding dungeons and treasures, maybe finding some exotic creatures too.<br />
Good reading!<br />
<br />
Tulpa:<br />
Tulpa is a concept in mysticism and the paranormal of a being or object which is created through spiritual or mental powers.<br />
It was adapted by 20th-century theosophists from Tibetan sprul-pa (Tibetan: à½¦à¾¤à¾²à½´à½£à¼‹à½”à¼‹, Wylie: sprulpa) which means "emanation body".<br />
Modern practitioners use the term to refer to a type of willed imagined being that practitioners consider to be sentient and relatively independent.<br />

<br />
Two adventurer siblings were walking in the forest as they always do, a little far from their house, they are a girl and a boy.<br />
The boy is called Izaque Bulkan, the girl is called Ana Bulkan, Izaque haves brown hair, Ana has blond hair.<br />
Izaque is the older brother, Ana is the younger one, they are living in the year 1571, on day fifteen of February.<br />
These two kids live in the universe of Gladius Fixous, Euclid Galaxy.<br />
The two siblings live on the planet Earth, in the country of Gemastria, state of Yolkland, close to Folkloria city.<br />
They see a mysterious hole on the ground, they discover that it is a hole that leads to a stairwell, and there is a big stone on top of the entrance.<br />
<br />
The boy decides to remove the stone that was on top of the hole, after that, they go inside it.<br />
Ana and Izaque continue to walk inside the dungeon, it is a little dark.<br />
Izaque grabs a lit torch from the wall to illuminate the way.<br />
The two walk a little more until they find a wall that looks like it was reconstructed, there are a lot of skulls and skeletons around it.<br />
"Maybe there's something behind this wall, it looks soft," says Izaque.<br />
"Yeah, let's walk more to see if we can find something to break it, bro," says Ana.<br />
"Okay little sis, hehe," says Izaque, smiling, they continue to walk further into the dungeon.<br />
<br />
Walking further, they find a pickax left by a corpse, the boy grabs it.<br />
"They're giving us pieces to the puzzle that is breaking the wall?" asks Izaque, doubtful.<br />
"I think so, let's go back to the wall to try to break it, bro," says Ana.<br />
Then the siblings walk back to the wall, Izaque and Ana switch between hitting the wall with the pickax.<br />
After some time, they manage to break the wall, pass through the hole and start to walk.<br />
They discover that it is a hall that leads to a room, and on the way, they find a lot of pictures and old portraits.<br />
"Do you think there's someone still alive here?" asks the boy, doubtful.<br />
<a class="text_light_brown" href="#Chapter_1_Reference_1">[1]</a><br />
<br />
Suddenly, the boy notices a picture on his right and says, "Look! This is my grandpa".<br />
The girl notices another picture and says, "There's a picture of my aunt here... There really is a stalker here".<br />
"A stalker that knows my family and yours, why is he interested in them?" asks the boy in doubt.<br />
"I don't know big bro, what your family has of importance?" asks the girl.<br />
"Hmm, I don't know, they are a little rich, and... Maybe they have something important, a lot of story behind it," explains the boy.<br />
"Maybe this guy knows something that we don't..." says the girl.<br />
<br />
They walk a little more and find a library with a lot of books, the boy grabs one, opens it, and starts to read.<br />
"Tim Burton, Day 23 of February of 1567, went fishing, came home and went to slept..." the boy interrupts his reading to do a comment, "This looks like a journal or a book from someone who was spying on another person," says the boy, gaping.<br />
He starts to read a lot of books until he finds one of his grandfather.<br />
"He has a boy by his side, seems to be his grandson, is looking at the waves of the sea..." the boy interrupts his reading again, "I remember exactly that day, this guy is really a stalker," says the boy, more surprised than ever.<br />
"Okay, I think we should go discover who is this stalker... Do you think we will be in danger, big bro?" asks the girl, hugging her brother's arm, scared.<br />
"No, I think we'll be fine, as long as we keep ourselves out of the sight of this stalker," replies Izaque, caressing her hair.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, they hear a rumble and a stamp of feet.<br />
"So brats are entering into my den eh?" asks a rough voice with a terrifying tone that appears from behind the duo, it is a man.<br />
He puts his two hands on the necks of the duo and lifts them, the duo trembles from fear and the girl punches his face.<br />
"I'll protect you, bro!" says Ana.<br />
Ana takes a chair on the side and throws it at the man, it breaks, and he screams in pain and gets distracted.<br />
Izaque grabs a bread roll that was on the table, "Me too, little sis!" says him, then he hits the head of the man a lot of times.<br />
<br />
They run to hide, the boy brings the bread roll and the girl brings an iron shell, they hide in a place of the dungeon.<br />
"Where are you brats!" says the angry man while throwing everything in the air to find them.<br />
"Oh, the things we get ourselves into, bro," says Ana trying to keep her voice low so as not to be discovered, she giggles a little.<br />
"Shush, little sis," says Izaque.<br />
The girl grabs a stone and throws it on the opposite side where they are to call the attention of the man.<br />
"Hmm?" says the man while walking in the direction of the noise of the stone.<br />
"Where are you, I know you're there, show up!" says the man enraged while he searches for the two in the place where the stone is.<br />
Ana signals to the boy, telling him to go that way, so they can escape the man.<br />
This song starts to play here and plays until the end:<br />
<div class="video-container" style="margin-top: 1%; margin-bottom: -6%;"><iframe type="text/html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" class="border_radius_5_cent border_4px border_color_light_brown" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9o3cEYOxAjs?autoplay=0&fs=1&iv_load_policy=1&showinfo=1&rel=0&cc_load_policy=1&start=0&end=0&" title="YouTube video player"></iframe></div><br /><br /><br /><br />
They walk slowly out of the sight of the man, losing him.<br />
<br />
They see that they are already far from the man and continue to walk.<br />
"I think we lost him", says Ana, relieved, hugging Izaque to not get away from him.<br />
"Yes, I'm glad you're safe, little sis," says Izaque.<br />
"Me too, bro, hehe," says Ana smiling, who kisses Izaque's cheek.<br />
They walk a little more, they find another hall and follow it.<br />
<br />

"Stalker is an English word that means "chaser" or "pursuer".<br />
It is applied to someone that importunes insistently and obsessively another person that, in a lot of cases, is a celebrity. The persistent chase can lead to attacks and aggression. [...]"<br />
<br />
The practice of spying and pursuing someone is called "stalking" (lurk). The term is used since the decade of 1980 when there was obsessed stalking of celebrities. In a lot of countries, it turned out to be considered a crime depending on the sentiment of the victim to the stalker. An example of a stalker is Stalker Sarah, a young girl known for taking photos with a lot of famous people and publishing it on the internet.<br />

		They arrive at a dead end, there is a paper on the ground.<br />
Izaque who is the wisest grabs the paper and reads, "In this room, there's something I like a lot, but I get rid of it if I need to, serves as fuel".<br />
Then the boy looks for something that serves as fuel, he finds a dark wooden trunk lying on the ground, when he picks it up he hears a sound of a mechanism activating (Minecraft piston).<br />
The boy notices that a hole has opened on the wall, he throws the log on the hole, it closes and a stairwell opens on the floor.<br />
They go down the stairwell and enter a room where there is a big rock, but it looks soft and easy to break, Izaque finds a pickax.<br />
Ana finds another one, she and Izaque start to hit the wall with the two pickaxes.<br />
After some time hitting the wall, they manage to break it.<br />
"Ladies first," says Izaque.<br />
"Thanks, big bro, you're so gentle," says Ana, smiling.<br />
<br />
Then the girl enters first and the boy comes in right after.<br />
They walk a little, the girl steps on the ground and triggers a trap, with quick reflexes the boy can pull her back and an iron arrow with a chain shoots through the wall.<br />
"T-Thanks for saving me big bro," says Ana, scared.<br />
"Why there are so many traps here?" asks Ana, angry.<br />
"Many? I think I only saw one, little sis," says Izaque.<br />
<br />
With a quick reflex, the girl throws the boy to the other side of the room and dodges a lot of spikes that come from the ceiling.<br />
"There's more, hehe," says Ana.<br />
"You're okay big bro?" asks her.<br />
"Yeah, thanks to you, little sis," replies Izaque, that gets up and cleans his clothes.<br />
"I think the way is still long, so watch out where you step..." says Ana that giggles a little.<br />
They keep walking until suddenly a spiked ball passes by them.<br />
"Watch out!" screams Ana.<br />
"You saved me again, thanks, little sis," says Izaque.<br />
"Here you can't really be distracted, big bro," says Ana.<br />
<br />
The siblings walk a little further and the traps stop appearing, they arrive at a tall, wide door.<br />
Then Izaque pushes the door and they are blinded by a yellowish light that comes from the inside of the room.<br />
"Where are we?" asks Ana.<br />
"I don't know, maybe some special room, or a treasured place," replies Izaque.<br />
After some time, they get used to the light and can see the room, they see a golden shiny sword stuck in a rock.<br />
And also a stone sign is attached to the wall above the sword that says: "Only the worthy of this sword can wield it, only the person of the same blood as the creator is worthy enough to do so."<br />
"Well, here I go," says Izaque, having faith in his strength and knowing that he is of the same blood as his grandfather.<br />
Izaque walks forward and tries to lift the sword, after using a lot of strength, he manages to get the sword off the rock, he realizes that the scabbard is on the side.<br />
He lifts the sword and it shines with the light of the candles around, looking like a real knight, he looks up, admiring the golden sword.<br />
"Wow..." says Ana, surprised, looking mindfully at the blade of the sword, "You look like a real knight, big bro!" says her, smiling, admiring her brother.<br />
"Thanks, little sis, hehe," says Izaque with his eyes shining, happy with his new weapon.<br />
<br />
After verifying and looking around the room, both notices that this was the room of the grandfather of Izaque and this was his sword.<br />
"Do you think he lived here? My grandpa, what he did here?" asks Izaque.<br />
Then Ana replies, "I don't know, maybe studied a little, read books, and wrote too..."<br />
"Is it just me or the stair is shining, big bro?" asks Ana.<br />
"Looks like it is, I think it's for us to go up then," replies Izaque while giggling a little, he grabs the scabbard and wears it.<br />
The glow of the stair gets intenser and the two start to walk on it, after some time walking, they arrive at an exit, there is some cool wind going on.<br />
"Well, looks like that guy won't go after us anymore, little sis," says Izaque.<br />
"He'll only go if he misses that... A shining sword..." says Ana, while looking at it.<br />
"The sword has probably been there in that rock for many years, because he is not worthy to take it, so it's of no use to him," says Izaque.<br />
<br />
The boy looks closely at the blade of the sword and sees the reflection of his grandfather in it, he looks back and sees no one.<br />
He feels a connection to his grandfather and the sword as if it were destined to be his.<br />
"Gee, you have a sword, and I don't even have a weapon, big bro..." says Ana a little sad.<br />
"Hmm, I'm sure you'll find something for you, little sis, you deserve it," says Izaque, smiling and hugging his sister.<br />
"Thanks, big bro, hehe," says Ana, returning the hug and beginning to smile again.<br />
"I think we should go home and clean this dusty sword of yours, big bro," says her, who kisses Izaque's cheek.<br />
"Okay, hehe," replies Izaque, smiling.<br />
The two siblings start to go back home on foot, Izaque stores the sword on the scabbard that is on his waist.

		After a long time, they arrive at their home and knock on the door.<br />
"Hey, you arrive-" says the scared mother, that interrupts her speech, "Oh my God," says the mother, surprised with the sword on the hands of the boy.<br />
"What did you two find?" asks the mother, who is called Rosa Winston Bulkan, "Grandpa's sword," replies Izaque.<br />
Then the mother says, "This sword was hidden for years, and it's a relic, but was destined to you my son, keep it well and take care of it, you deserve it, use it wisely Izaque".<br />
"Well, we went through a lot to find that hidden sword," says Ana.<br />
"Oh, and where was it?" asks Rosa.<br />
"It was in a dungeon that we found, we had to run from a tall guy who appeared to be a stalker <a class="text_light_brown" href="#Chapter_3_Reference_1">[1]</a> of our family," replies Izaque.<br />
Rosa becomes a little sad by hearing what Izaque said, she thinks about something, the siblings do not know the reason for her sadness.<br />
"My God! You two have to be more careful! And you Izaque, protect your sister well, and Ana, also protect your brother," says Rosa in a worried tone.<br />
"I will mom, don't worry," says Izaque, hugging Ana.<br />
"Me too, hehe, he protected me well on the dungeon," says Ana, smiling.<br />
<br />
Then the siblings enter the house.<br />
Izaque goes to his room and grabs a cloth to clean the dusty sword.<br />
He puts it into the scabbard, putting it in a hidden place, then he goes outside, on the yard.<br />
"How about we practice aiming with Dad's bow and arrow?" asks Ana, smiling.<br />
Then Izaque asks, "What do you mean? Who shoots whom?"<br />
"We gonna shoot straw dolls, big bro," replies Ana, smiling.<br />
"Okay little sis," says Izaque, a little sad.<br />
"Are you still worried about the sword thing, big bro? You seem so down," asks Ana, worried about her brother, she hugs him.<br />
"I don't know, I think I'm just not used to using it, maybe I'm not ready for it," replies Izaque.<br />
"Oh, of course, you're ready big bro! And if you're not," Ana poses like a knight and then says in a deep voice, "I will train you, young man, hehe," then she laughs a little.<br />
<br />
"Hehe, okay, thanks little sis," says Izaque, beginning to smile again and caressing Ana's hair.<br />
Izaque goes to his room, wears his scabbard, and then comes back to the yard.<br />
Ana grabs some straw and some old clothes to make the doll, the siblings make the doll together.<br />
After some time making, they have a ready straw doll.<br />
"So, who goes first, little sis?" asks Izaque.<br />
"You can go first, big bro," replies Ana.<br />
Izaque then grabs his sword and hits the right side of the belly of the doll, cutting it a little.<br />
"Be careful not to destroy it all, big bro," says Ana.<br />
"Okay, I won't little sis," says Izaque, who then giggles.<br />
Then Ana shoots an arrow aiming at the head of the doll and hits it.<br />
"I think I've already trained a lot by hitting some people over the head with a rolling pin," says Izaque who then laughs a little.<br />
Then Ana says, "Really? The rolling pin couldn't cut him in half big bro, hehe," and then smiles a little.<br />
"Yeah, hehe," says Izaque, smiling back.<br />
<br />
After a while, Ana and Izaque leave to venture out again, Izaque leaves the sword at home.<br />
"Where are we going this time, big bro?" asks Ana.<br />
"I don't know, it's always someplace new, we always discover something new, little sis," replies Izaque, smiling.<br />
They continue walking, always attentive to the sounds and noises around them, not to be caught off guard.<br />
Then a sound of someone stepping on a dry leaf sounds behind them.<br />
"Did you hear something, big bro?" asks Ana while looking behind her quickly.<br />
"I did, little sis," says Izaque, agitated and looking everywhere.<br />
<br />
Suddenly a deep voice surges behind them shouting "Rrrraaaa!" and trying to catch Ana.<br />
But Ana quickly jumps forward and escapes from the hands of the man, she and Izaque start to run.<br />
Until after much persecution, the two siblings manage to confuse the man and hide in a hole.<br />
Izaque notices that the steps of the man are far away.<br />
"Do you think he's gone, big bro?" asks Ana, worried.<br />
"Maybe, be quieter please, little sis," replies Izaque, whispering, hearing the sounds.<br />
<br />
Izaque grabs a stone and tries to throw it away from where the hole is.<br />
He hears the sound of the stone falling to the ground in the distance and no more sound.<br />
"I'm gonna take a look, stay down there, little sis," says Izaque, with that he puts his head outside of the hole to check the area.<br />
"Clear, over," says Izaque, smiling a little.<br />
Ana gets out of the hole saying, "Hehe, I think he really missed the sword, over".<br />
"I agree, over," says Izaque while laughing a little.<br />
"I think we shouldn't go home yet, he can follow us and discover where we live little sis," explains Izaque.<br />
Then Ana retorts, "Yeah, but mom's gonna get worried, big bro..."<br />
"I take the blame, he wants our heads, not our mother's," says Izaque.<br />
"Okay, thanks big bro," replies Ana, who hugs Izaque.<br />
<br />
The two siblings start to walk around while looking at the surroundings to try to spot the man.<br />
They walk a little and do not find any signal of the man.<br />
"Well, looks like he got tired of us little sis," says Izaque.<br />
Ana replies relieved, "Oh, I'm glad we're safe, big bro".<br />
"What should we do now little sis? Go back home?" asks Izaque.<br />
Then Ana replies, "Let's be very careful and hope he doesn't see us, big bro".<br />
"Good one, little sis," says Izaque.<br />
They start walking slowly back home, it is almost dark.<br />
After a while, they arrive at the door of the house and knock on it.<br />
"Do you think we'll be scolded big bro?" asks Ana.<br />
"Probably little sis, for staying out this late.<br />
You don't need to say anything little sis, leave it to me," replies Izaque.<br />
<br />
The mother opens the door saying, "Hello, my dears".<br />
"Hey mom, d-don't you think we stayed out too late?" asks Izaque, scared to get scolded.<br />
"Yeah, you did, I just wanna know why," asks Rosa.<br />
Izaque explains stuttering a little and with a shaky voice, "It's that we had a setback on the way, but nothing we couldn't face".<br />
"Oh really? And what did you face?" asks Rosa.<br />
Then Izaque replies, trying to formulate a plausible answer, "Hmm... Ana was scared of some mice that ran after us".<br />
"Yeah, and Izaque, as always, protected me," says Ana with a forced smile, hugging Izaque.<br />
Then the mother replies, "Okay, come on in, dinner is ready".<br />
The two siblings enter inside the house, Rosa closes the door.<br />
Rosa says, "Sit down to eat, Ana, you too, Izaque".<br />
"Okay, mom," says Izaque and Ana.<br />
<br />
Ana sits at the table and Izaque too.<br />
"So, how are the things around here, mom?" asks Ana, smiling.<br />
Rosa replies, "They're good, I'm very protected here".<br />
"And how's the food kids?" asks Rosa.<br />
Izaque replies saying, "It's delicious as always mom," who then smiles.<br />
"Yes, it's very good, mom, thanks," says Ana.<br />
"No problem my dears," says Rosa, smiling.<br />
<br />
Everyone finishes eating and goes to their beds.<br />
Ana and Izaque are still awake, trying to sleep while looking at the ceiling, they sleep on the same bed.<br />
"Hey little sis, do you think he's gonna come chasing us again?" asks Izaque.<br />
"I think so... But if he can't get the sword, why the hell is he still interested in it big bro?" asks Ana, who hugs Izaque.<br />
"I don't know, maybe to stay with it, or sell it, or another deeper reason that we don't know, but what I want is to protect mom," replies Izaque, caressing Ana's hair.<br />
Then Ana says with a worried tone, "At least he doesn't know where we are big bro..."<br />
Then they sleep on a silent night, hugged.<br />
<br />

"Stalker is an English word that means "chaser" or "pursuer".<br />
It is applied to someone that importunes insistently and obsessively another person that, in a lot of cases, is a celebrity. The persistent chase can lead to attacks and aggression. [...]"<br />
<br />
The practice of spying and pursuing someone is called "stalking" (lurk). The term is used since the decade of 1980 where there was obsessed stalking of celebrities. In a lot of countries, it turned out to be considered a crime depending on the sentiment of the victim to the stalker. An example of a stalker is Stalker Sarah, a young girl known for taking photos with a lot of famous people and publishing it on the internet.<br />

		The siblings wake up and see the sun shining through the window.<br />
It is a little cold, they love cold mornings with the sun to warm them up.<br />
The duo goes out to feel the morning sun.<br />
"Good morning!" says Ana, smiling.<br />
"Good morning, hehe," says Izaque, smiling too.<br />
"Did you sleep well little sis?" asks Izaque.<br />
"Yeah, I always sleep well with you by my side big bro," replies Ana, who hugs Izaque.<br />
"Hehe, I love you, little sis," says Izaque, kissing Ana's cheek.<br />
"I love you too, bro," says Ana, kissing Izaque's cheek back.<br />
Then the two siblings go back inside the house, do their morning needs, and go to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Their mother had already prepared breakfast, "Come and eat my little ones," says Rosa.<br />
The siblings sit at the table and the mother goes to the back of the house to wash some clothes.<br />
"Did you have a weird dream too, big bro?" asks Ana, curious.<br />
So Izaque asks, "I don't think so, what kind of dream little sis?"<br />
"I don't know, I dreamed about that hole that we got inside yesterday, big bro," replies Ana.<br />
"Hmm, I don't think I dreamed with nothing related to that," says Izaque.<br />
"I have a bad feeling, big bro," says Ana.<br />
"Why little sis?" asks Izaque, worried.<br />
<br />
After thinking a little, Ana replies.<br />
"Because... The dream seemed very real big bro."<br />
"Do you think it was a prediction, little sis?" asks Izaque.<br />
"I don't know, maybe big bro, do you think it's a good idea to go there again?" asks Ana, curious.<br />
Izaque stays thoughtful for some time and then replies to her.<br />
"I don't know, what if we get hurt, little sis? We were very lucky last time, I don't wanna put you in danger again..."<br />
"Now we have the sword, big bro, if we train a little together, you can become good with it," says Ana smiling.<br />
"Yeah, it's a shame that there's no zombie here for us to train little sis," says Izaque.<br />
"You're reading too many fairy tales big bro, hehe, zombies don't exist.<br />
I'm the younger sibling and you're the one who reads fairy tales, hehe," says Ana, giggling a little.<br />
"Hehe, you cutie," says Izaque smiling, who pinches Ana's cheek.<br />
<br />
Ana smiles and thinks a little, then she replies to the boy.<br />
"Hmm... But it would be cool and at the same time bad if zombies existed, big bro."<br />
"Why little sis?" asks Izaque.<br />
"Because zombies can infect other people, it's hard to contain an infection like that big bro," replies Ana.<br />
"And those people become other zombies that infect others, thus generating a chain reaction," adds Izaque.<br />
"Yeah, it's just like that, big bro," says Ana.<br />
<br />
After finishing chewing his bread with butter, Izaque asks something.<br />
"So, how are we gonna train little sis? There's nothing alive around here."<br />
Then Ana replies, "And we wouldn't kill an alive animal big bro".<br />
"Yeah, not even mice," says Izaque that giggles a little.<br />
"That's right, hehe," says Ana, right after laughing a little.<br />
Izaque replies while giggling, "Well, I think we're gonna have to learn it by sheer effort then, little sis".<br />
"So, let's go out and walk around little sis?" asks Izaque.<br />
"Oh, okay, let's go, big bro," replies Ana.<br />
"We gonna go on an adventure mom!" says Izaque from the kitchen.<br />
"Okay, take care of your sister Izaque!" says Rosa from the back of the house.<br />
<br />
Then the siblings get out of the house and start to walk into the forest.<br />
They walk a little, after some time, they arrive at the forest and enter it, they start to walk.<br />
After some time, Ana perceives that there are some weird trees near where the duo was walking.<br />
She warns her brother saying, "I think I already saw those trees big bro..."<br />
The trees had holes that looked like scratches made by claws, and inside the holes there seemed to be gold.<br />
They walk a little further and perceive that they are stepping on the root of a giant tree.<br />
Ana looks forward and sees that there is something written on a wall made of the wood trunk.<br />
She sees that there is an ax stuck on a wooden trunk.<br />
Then reads the sign that says, "This ax was forged with the claws of the wolves that lived in this forest, the blade of the ax was made of the fervor and courage of the wolves, only a worthy being can wield it".<br />
Ana while looking at it, notices that the ax is made of gold.<br />
<br />
She faces it and says, "Oh, big bro... I saw this ax in my dream!"<br />
Ana then puts her hand on the ax and feels an extreme force, she has a vision of a lot of people, ages, the generations that used this ax.<br />
She hears a voice saying, "You deserve this weapon, this power, take it, it is yours," Ana then pulls the ax with force and it gets off the tree trunk.<br />
Ana strikes a blow against a tree with her ax and says in an excited tone, "Wow, this is awesome big bro, look at this! Hehe".<br />
"Congrats, little sis, hehe, you deserve it," says Izaque smiling at his sister, hugging her, happy by her achievement.<br />
"Thanks, big bro, hehe," says Ana, hugging Izaque back.<br />
They continue walking further in the forest.<br />
Then find an open temple that looks to be very old, they get inside and get a torch to light the way.<br />
"There must be some treasures here, little sis," says Izaque.<br />
"Now I want to know who gonna dare to confront us, big bro! I'm gonna protect you, hehe," says Ana excited with her new weapon, feeling powerful, smiling at her brother.<br />
"Yeah, little sis! I'll also protect you," says Izaque excited too, smiling.<br />
<br />
Then a kind of mummy wolf appears, it growls and tries to attack them.<br />
"Well... I said that big bro, but this was pretty quick," says Ana worried.<br />
Then Ana gets in front of Izaque to protect him.<br />
"Calm down there little wolf!" says Ana, who strikes the wolf hard.<br />
The wolf gets a cut on his front paw and growls, then starts walking in the direction of Ana growling and angry.<br />
While the wolf is distracted, Izaque runs to the back of the wolf and tries to find something to use against it, trying to help his sister.<br />
Ana that was in a hard situation, growls back at the wolf.<br />
<br />
Izaque finds a rope and discovers that there is a hole behind the wolf.<br />
He gets the rope and mimes for Ana saying that he is going to throw the wolf in the hole, pulling it by the neck with the rope.<br />
Ana kicks the wolf in the face, which growls even louder at her.<br />
Izaque gets the rope and throws it on the neck of the wolf, locking the rope and pulling it back with all his strength.<br />
Until he finally can throw the wolf in the hole.<br />
"What a heavy thing, needs to lose some weight," says Izaque, who after that gives a short laugh, the wolf stays growling at them on the hole.<br />
"Is this the only thing this temple has to offer? We hit it off!<br />
Don't you think big bro?" asks Ana who soon after stretches out her hand to Izaque and they do a high-five.<br />
"I agree little sis, pound it!" replies Izaque in an animated tone.<br />
"Let's go forward before the owner of the temple calls another guard dog, big bro," says Ana.<br />
<br />
They walk more and find a lot of portraits and pictures of warriors, Izaque picks up a book that was on top of a table and reads it.<br />
"This is the book to show and register the greatness and the courage of these brave warriors, their history and legacy must be kept and remembered forever."<br />
"I don't want to read all that, ouch," says Izaque, who laughs briefly, throwing the book where it was.<br />
They continue walking more around the hallway and find some type of altar close to where they were.<br />
There was a yellow light shining, they come closer and see that there are a yellow lamp and a glass cup on top of a pilaster.<br />
"This cup looks to be important, but looks so fragile too, why is it so important, little sis?" Izaque wonders.<br />
"Does it have some bewitched beverage big bro?" asks Ana.<br />
"I don't know, maybe it has, or a miraculous potion that makes you very strong little sis," replies Izaque.<br />
<br />
Ana thinks a little and asks.<br />
"Why don't we look a closer look big bro?"<br />
"Okay little sis," replies Izaque.<br />
Then the siblings look at the cup closer.<br />
"Hmm, you know big bro, I'm a little thirsty..." says Ana, smiling.<br />
Then Izaque says, worried with his sister, "I don't think you should drink that little sis, it looks dangerous".<br />
"Why not big bro? Dad always drank alcohol in front of us," asks Ana.<br />
Izaque asks, doubtful, "I don't know, what if it's poison little sis?"<br />
"Only because it has a skull on the cup, dark bubbles coming off the water, smoke with a horrible smell.<br />
And a lot of skeletons around the table, big bro?" asks Ana, not at all worried.<br />
"Maybe, perhaps all these skeletons died because they took a sip of this delicious cursed juice," says Izaque in a sarcastic way.<br />
<br />
Then Ana asks, "How you're going to tell mom that I died poisoned, big bro?"<br />
"I think it would be a little hard, little sis," replies Izaque.<br />
"So how about we both drink it, big bro?<br />
I-I know that this may sound dark and heavy, but... If I'll die, I wanna die with you," asks Ana, hugging Izaque tight.<br />
Then Izaque looks at Ana, he kisses her cheek and hugs her back, "I love you, little sis," says him.<br />
"I love you too, big bro.<br />
Also, why is nobody protecting this, big bro?" asks Ana.<br />
"Maybe because it's a trap, maybe someone who deserves can drink this liquid and not die, little sis," says Izaque.<br />
"So, let's drink it together big bro, I want to stay with you... Even if I die..." says Ana.<br />
<br />
The two drink the weird drink together, they do not feel anything in the beginning.<br />
Then, after some time, Izaque looks at Ana and says while stuttering scared, "Yo-Your skin is getting green little sis".<br />
"And those seem to be dragon scales on you too," says Izaque.<br />
"Oh my, I-I think that was liquid marijuana big bro!" says Ana scared.<br />
"Maybe I guess," says Izaque who then laughs a little.<br />
"But everything is normal for me, only you that is green little sis," says Izaque.<br />
<br />
Then Izaque finds a book nearby and reads it, the book says, "This potion is experimental, can work with you, or you could die.<br />
We don't know what it can do if you don't die, or in what it can turn you into, maybe a dragon, it is better not to drink it."<br />
"I think it needs a more explicit warning of danger, or we're blind and didn't see the skulls on the side of the cup, little sis," says Izaque.<br />
"Have you only seen this book there now, big bro?" asks Ana, a little worried.<br />
Then Izaque replies, "Yeah... My bad, sorry little sis".<br />
"Oh my... It's okay big bro," says Ana, worried, who hugs Izaque.<br />
Izaque asks worried and scared, "So we're gonna become dragons? How are we gonna tell this to mom? When will it pass?"<br />
"And if it doesn't work, will we die?<br />
W-Well... I wouldn't mind dying with you... Sorry, I'm too tenebrous aren't I big bro?" asks Ana, a little sad.<br />
"No... It's okay little sis, I wouldn't mind dying with you too..." says Izaque, hugging Ana and kissing her cheek, she smiles a little.<br />
<br />
Then they break from the hug, it looks like everything is in slow motion for them, Ana is worried and puts her hands on her head.<br />
Izaque moves his head to look at the ceiling, feeling a little nauseous like everything is spinning around him.<br />
The boy falls to the ground and Ana gets worried, trying to wake up him.<br />
"Big bro, get up bro! Broooooooooo! Noooooo!" says the girl, scared to death and thinking that her brother died.<br />
Then Izaque gets up, asking, "What's up? I just laid on the floor to sleep a little, don't worry about meh little sis".<br />
"You sound completely drunk big bro, what the hell?" says Ana, laughing a little.<br />
"Noh, I'mma fine," says Izaque, that gives a hiccup, then continues, speaking with a drunk voice, "Let me just rest a little okay little sis..."<br />
Ana while crouching and holding Izaque's hand, asks for him to get up.<br />
<br />
After some time of trying, Ana succeeds to wake up Izaque, he gets up.<br />
Then Ana asks the question again, "And if it doesn't work, we'll die big bro?"<br />
Izaque replies, "I don't know, the book says that if you don't die after drinking it, something other than death can happen, that was what I understood".<br />
"Okay big bro...<br />
Then, what do we do big bro? Search for more treasures or get out?" asks Ana.<br />
"Let's continue... Even if I'm starting to have a headache, are we already on a hangover?" asks Izaque.<br />
"I don't big bro, when dad lived with us, he said it took one day for the hangover to appear," replies Ana.<br />
<br />
Izaque and Ana had become dragons because of the potion.<br />
The boy was a purple-scaled dragon with the rest of his body yellow.<br />
The sister was a blue-scared dragon and with the rest of her body black.<br />
"This is not so bad big bro," says Ana looking at her body and admiring herself, shaking her tail.<br />
"Yeah little sis, you're so cute," replies Izaque looking at himself too.<br />
Ana burps fire through her mouth and says excitedly, "I like this, hehe".<br />
Izaque flies low and burps fire while rotating and says excitedly, "This is awesome! I love fire! I love to be a dragon!"<br />
"Now I want to see who shows up in front of us!" says Izaque, excited.<br />
"Yeah big bro, let's go!" says Ana, testing her new powers.<br />
<br />
They continue to walk within the temple, the two hear a heavy and loud breath.<br />
Izaque opens a high door and finds a dark room, the two decide to enter there.<br />
They walk a little and Ana asks while she looks at her brother, "Do you feel that smell big bro?"<br />
"What smell?" asks Izaque, that right after lights a torch and discovers that they are very close to a giant dragon that is sleeping.<br />
The dragon has red scales and the rest of his body is orange, he occupies half of the room with his body.<br />
They take a slight leap back when they get scared.<br />
"Oh, that smell..." says Izaque in shock but trying to not wake up the dragon.<br />

"This is what must be keeping the treasure big bro.<br />
I think we should come here later, he must be tired," says Ana.<br />
"Hmm, I agree big sis, but I think we should try to talk to him, to try to...<br />
Ask for a little of his treasure? Maybe it'll work," whispers Izaque, a little unsure.<br />
"Oh, I don't know, we could try big bro," says Ana.<br />
<br />
The two of them look behind the dragon, they see a pile of gold coins and gems.<br />
On top of the pile, there is a shiny blue sword and a golden chest.<br />
"Hmm... Hey mister dragon," says Izaque, touching the dragon two times with his dragon finger.<br />
The dragon moves his nose like he was smelling something, he sighs and opens his eyes, getting his head up.<br />
"Oh, two little dragons, what do you two want?" asks the dragon, smiling.<br />
"Well... We're two dragons that came from far away, from another continent.<br />
So like, we're planning to move to this continent, and we dragons like to guard treasures right? I know because I'm a dragon too.<br />
So I was meaning to ask if you could please give a little of your treasure, you know, we don't have any treasure to guard right now," explains Izaque.<br />
"Oh, two foreign dragons, I see, okay, my name is Kirin Gerard.<br />
You can take a little gold, the blue sword, and the golden chest," says Kirin Gerard, the dragon, walking a little to the left to show the treasure.<br />
The dragon walking in the temple produces huge trembles.<br />
"Thanks, mister dragon, my name is Izaque," says Izaque, who smiles at the dragon, looking high to see his face.<br />
"My name is Ana," says Ana.<br />
"Nice to meet you Izaque and Ana, if you don't mind me, I'm gonna sleep more, I'm a little tired," says Kirin Gerard, laying on the ground.<br />
Then the two siblings walk to the treasure, Ana gets the blue sword and a bag of gold coins, and Izaque gets the golden chest.<br />
<br />
"So, let's go home little sis?" asks Izaque, smiling at Ana.<br />
"Okay big bro," replies Ana, they get out of the room where the dragon is sleeping.<br />
"Close the door please, I don't like sunlight, leave it just a little open," says Kirin Gerard, the dragon.<br />
Then the two siblings do that, the dragon says thanks, and the duo starts to walk out of the temple.<br />
"Will Mommy believe this is a costume?" asks Ana.<br />
"I think so, hehe, I hope little sis," replies Izaque, Ana laughs.<br />
"You made a very convincing story back there big bro, how did you do that?" asks Ana.<br />
"Well, I read a lot of storybooks about dragons and stuff, and medieval fantasy stories.<br />
And I like dragons a lot, that's why I loved to become a dragon, hehe, it was cool to talk to another dragon," replies Izaque.<br />
"Oh, hehe, you have a lot of knowledge big bro," says Ana, smiling.<br />
"Thanks, little sis," says Izaque smiling too.

		They start coming back home with the golden chest, blue sword, and bag of gold coins.<br />
Arriving there, they knock on the door, the mother opens and says, "Ah, you're her- Wait, who are you?"<br />
"It's us mom, Ana, and Izaque, can't you notice Ana's cuteness even as a dragon?" asks Izaque smiling.<br />
Ana burps fire and says, "Hello mom".<br />
"How and why you're dragons?" asks unbelieving Rosa.<br />
Ana asks, "So... Remember when you said to not accept things from strangers?"<br />
"I do, why?" asks Rosa.<br />
"No stranger has offered anything, we've just picked it up," replies Ana.<br />
Then Rosa asks, "What do you mean?"<br />
"We drank something that we shouldn't," replies Ana.<br />
The mother asks again, "And this thing turned you into dragons?"<br />
"Yes, we even talked with a dragon," replies Izaque.<br />
"Oh, really?" asks Rosa.<br />
"Yeah, Izaque said he read a lot of storybooks about dragons, he created a very convincing story.<br />
He asked for a little of the dragon's treasure, so the dragon let us get his treasure.<br />
That's why we have this blue sword and golden chest, and this bag of gold coins," replies Ana.<br />
"That's very good Izaque! Thanks, son, that will help me when I visit the town again to buy some food.<br />
Well, I'm sure that the effect will go away soon, come inside my dears," says Rosa.<br />
"No problem mom, hehe," says Izaque.<br />
<br />
Ana enters the house flying low and Izaque enters walking, they leave the blue sword, golden chest, and the bag of gold coins in a corner of the kitchen.<br />
"The dinner is ready, darlings," says Rosa.<br />
Izaque sits at the table and Ana too, and both of them start to eat.<br />
"Do you know what is inside the chest son?" asks the mother while looking at him.<br />
Izaque then replies, "I don't know mom, I still have to open it".<br />
"Hmm, okay, I hope it's nothing dangerous," says worried Rosa about her children.<br />
"It's not, we're gonna be fine, right big bro?" asks Ana, smiling at Izaque.<br />
"Yeah, hehe," replies Izaque.<br />
They finish eating and go to their bedrooms to sleep hugging, it is a little cold, Izaque hugs Ana tight, it is weird to feel her scales.<br />
Izaque wonders if he will wake up as a dragon or not.<br />
<br />
It is already morning, Izaque goes to the bathroom to look at the mirror and says excitedly, "I'm still a dragon, yahoo!"<br />
Ana does the same and says, "Let's burn some insects, hehe".<br />
"That would be cool, I wanted to find other dragons too little sis, swim in lava," says Izaque.<br />
"I think swimming in lava is just a myth, big bro," says Ana.<br />
Then Izaque replies, "I don't know, maybe it will work with the thick skin of the dragons, the scales".<br />
"Kids, come eat breakfast," says Rosa from the kitchen.<br />
"Okay mom," says Izaque from the bathroom, he and Ana do their morning needs in the bathroom.<br />
The two start to walk to the kitchen, Ana feels the smell of breakfast and smiles.<br />
<br />
The two arrive at the kitchen and sit at the table, the mother who was washing the dishes looks back and asks, "Are you still dragons?"<br />
"Yeah, hehe," says Izaque smiling.<br />
They eat breakfast and go to their room, Izaque tries to open the golden chest.<br />
He succeeds and finds the Infinity Gauntlet of Thanos with six jewels of different colors stuck to it.<br />
There is a blue one, yellow, orange, red, green, and purple.<br />
"Wow..." says Ana looking at the gauntlet, surprised.<br />
Izaque wears the gauntlet and feels a lot of power flowing through his veins.<br />
"I expected a little gold," says Ana disappointed.<br />
Izaque extends his hand and closes his eyes, he imagines something and moves his hands.<br />
"Big bro?" asks Ana worried about what her brother is about to do.<br />
<br />
Izaque snaps his fingers, and suddenly, a lot of gold coins fall to the ground coming from the gauntlet.<br />
"This is awesome!" says Izaque while looking at the gauntlet.<br />
Ana says excitedly, "You created coins, big bro!"<br />
"Yeah little sis, hehe," says Izaque excited too.<br />
"Wow... Let me see it, big bro," says Ana, that goes closer to the brother, wanting to test the Infinity Gauntlet.<br />
"I don't think it's a good idea little sis, sorry," says Izaque, that moves the gauntlet away from Ana.<br />
"It's better to put it away, it's dangerous little sis..." says Izaque worried, who then puts the Infinity Gauntlet in the chest.<br />
"Oh, okay, sorry big bro," says Ana.<br />
"It's okay little sis," says Izaque, who caresses Ana's hair.<br />
"Let's go on an adventure till the hour of lunch little sis?" asks Izaque.<br />
"Let's go, big bro," replies Ana.<br />
<br />
Then the siblings go on another adventure.<br />
Izaque brings his grandpa's sword in the sheath, the blue sword, and something more in his backpack.<br />
Ana brings her trusty ax.<br />
"We could use these new wings, big bro," says Ana, flapping her wings.<br />
"Yeah little sis," says Izaque, excited to test them.<br />
Then they start to fly, and after some time, they decide to come down to a temple.<br />
They start to walk inside the temple, suddenly, they hear a bang and feel a trembling on the ground.<br />
"What's happening big bro?" asks Ana in shock.<br />
"I don't know little sis, maybe it's an earthquake, or a big creature walking," replies Izaque, scared.<br />
<br />
They walk more and arrive in the room where Kirin Gerard lived, the giant dragon that gave some of his treasure to the siblings, he is awake.<br />
"Oh, it's you two again, sorry, did I bother you with my walking?<br />
It causes trembles on the ground because I'm so heavy, hehe," asks Kirin Gerard, the dragon.<br />
"Oh, no, it's okay, hehe.<br />
We're just here to visit you a little, and explore more of this temple," replies Izaque.<br />
"Okay then, hehe," says the dragon, he moves his treasure a little and organizes some of the things in his den, he then lies on the ground.<br />
"Hey Kirin Gerard, do you live here? Like, have you lived here for a long time?" asks Izaque to the dragon.<br />
"Yeah, I've been living here for quite some time, maybe a year.<br />
Something... Weird happened, that made me stay here, and I think I'm too big to pass through the hallways," replies Kirin Gerard, a little sad that he is trapped.<br />
"Hmm, it must be hard for you, do you want help in leaving this temple?" asks Izaque.<br />
"No, it's okay, I like to stay here, I would want help with finding food and jewels if you want to help with that.<br />
I eat vegetables, meat, jewels, and some ores," replies the dragon.<br />
"Oh, okay, we're gonna bring those things to you, hehe," says Izaque.<br />
"Thanks, hehe," says Kirin Gerard.<br />
<br />
"So, I think we're going, see you later, friend," says Izaque, smiling.<br />
"Friend?" asks Kirin Gerard.<br />
"Yeah, why?" asks Ana.<br />
"I-I never had a friend before... I was always alone with my treasure..." says the dragon, who starts crying with happiness.<br />
"Aww, how cute," says Ana smiling.<br />
"This dragon life is tough... You have a big treasure, and no one to share it with," says Kirin Gerard.<br />
"Oh, I know how it is... I'm glad you shared your treasure with us," says Izaque, smiling.<br />
"Yeah, you were so gentle to me, and you were the first dragons that I met that didn't steal me," says Kirin Gerard, the dragon.<br />
"Aww," says Ana and Izaque in unison, smiling.<br />
"So, bye, friends, hehe," says Kirin Gerard.<br />
"Bye, friend," says Izaque and Ana together, smiling at the dragon.<br />
Then two dragon siblings start to walk out of the temple.<br />
The dragon's voice echoes through the big hallways, saying, "Come back whenever you want, friends!"<br />
"Bye! Friend," says Ana, smiling.<br />
<br />
Then the siblings get out of the temple, they start flying high in the sky.<br />
"I like Kirin Gerard, he's very friendly, don't you think, little sis?" asks Izaque.<br />
"Yeah, he was very pacific and gentle big bro," replies Ana.<br />
The two decide to go again into the weird hole they saw the other day.

		After some time, the two siblings arrive there flying with their dragon wings.<br />
"Do you think he's still here big bro?" asks Ana.<br />
"I think so, little sis," says Izaque.<br />
Then the siblings enter inside the hole.<br />
They walk a little and find the man from the other time.<br />
He is on his back and hears the footsteps of the duo.<br />
The man turns back quickly, saying with anger, "Dragons here? Wait, I know that sword! You're the boy who stole it!"<br />
He grabs an ax and an iron shield and goes close to the two.<br />
"I'll protect you big bro!" says Ana, who soon after blows fire through her mouth.<br />
The man notices the fire and defends himself with the iron shield.<br />
"Go, big bro, I'll distract him," says Ana to Izaque.<br />
"Okay little sis," says Izaque.<br />
<br />
The boy runs to another place to try to flee from the man.<br />
Ana blows fire on the man, then she picks up her ax and goes after the man.<br />
Izaque that is in another room, grabs something from inside his backpack and prepares himself.<br />
He then runs to the room where Ana was fighting with the man and shouts, "Stay away, little sis!"<br />
Ana moves away and Izaque shoots a big purple and weird ball in the man.<br />
He gets stuck in some type of dimensional shield.<br />
"This glove is very good," says Izaque looking at it.<br />
The man hits something that sounds like glass, saying, "Get me out of here you little brats!"<br />
<br />
"Wow," says Ana, surprised.<br />
Then she asks, "You did that big bro?"<br />
"Yeah, I thought about something to get him away and that thing appeared," replies Izaque.<br />
"So, what do we do now little sis? Runaway and release him?" asks Izaque.<br />
"I'm not sure big bro, he might come back," says Ana, that after that looks at the man.<br />
"I'm gonna find a place for us to leave him, little sis," says Izaque.<br />
"But first... What's your name?" asks Izaque to the man.<br />
The man sighs, realizing he does not have a choice, he answers, "My name is Fred Bulkan..."<br />
Izaque thinks a little and then asks, "Why you're spying on our family?"<br />
"Because I'm fascinated by the Winston family...<br />
All of its history... Culture, the things they did," replies Fred.<br />
"What do you mean?" asks Ana, curious.<br />
Fred then replies, "Like... It started when I was eleven, I had gone traveling with my father.<br />
I have traveled through many villages and met a lot of people, but no family that has fascinated me more than yours".<br />
"You can keep the sword, I won't pursue you anymore," says Fred looking down, a little sad.<br />
<br />
Ana supports the ax on her shoulder and thinks a little.<br />
"You live with your mother right?" asks Fred.<br />
"Yeah... Why?" asks Izaque a little scared.<br />
Then Fred says, "So take good care of her and protect her".<br />
"Why do you have so much interest anyway?" asks Ana, curious.<br />
"I don't know... I like to search and register things, like a book I read one time.<br />
The book said, 'This is the book to show and register the greatness and the courage of these brave warriors, the history and the legacy of them must be kept and remembered forever'," replies Fred.<br />
"Wait... Why did you attack us?" asks Ana.<br />
"Because I thought that you were simple brats trying to steal my things...<br />
I didn't know that you were from the family that I was researching about," replies Fred.<br />
"So... Are you gonna release me?" asks Fred.<br />
"Yes, I think he is not a threat anymore, little sis," replies Izaque looking at Ana.<br />
Then Izaque snaps his two fingers using his Infinity Gauntlet and releases Fred from the dimensional shield.<br />
He goes back to doing his things on his table, researching.<br />
"So, let's go, little sis," says Izaque.<br />
"Okay big bro," says Ana.<br />
<br />
Izaque and Ana come back home flying with their dragon wings.<br />
"It was nice to make friends with both of them little sis, the dragon, and the man," says Izaque.<br />
Then Ana asks, "Didn't you suspect that guy ask about our mother, big bro?"<br />
"Hmm, no little sis, I think I would suspect if he asked 'Do you live alone?'," replies Izaque.<br />
"He knows our mother, big bro," says Ana.<br />
"I think I suspected a little, but what harm can he do to us?<br />
If he wants to register our family, it wouldn't make sense for him to hurt us, little sis," asks Izaque.<br />
"He said he didn't recognize us for the first time, big bro," says Ana.<br />
Then Izaque asks, "And what about it, little sis?"<br />
"I don't know, I feel like we already know him, big bro," replies Ana.<br />
"I'm not sure, he is not from our family, so I think that's hard," says Izaque.<br />
"Hmm..." says Ana, thoughtful.<br />
Then two siblings start to walk to their house.

		The two siblings arrive at their house for lunch.<br />
They knock on the door and Rosa opens and says, "Come in my sweeties, lunch is ready".<br />
The siblings sit at the table and start to eat.<br />
"Hey mom... Where do you think daddy went?" asks Ana.<br />
The mother replies while looking at the window that showed the beautiful sky of the afternoon, "Oh... I don't know my dear, it has been a while..."<br />
"Do you think he could still be alive today?..." asks Ana, curious.<br />
"Yes... I think so," replies Rosa.<br />
<br />
Ana looks at Izaque with a worried face.<br />
"But why do you wanna know, daughter?" asks the mother looking at Ana.<br />
"Only curiosity mom..." says Ana while playing with her food, worried and with a sad look.<br />
"The food is wonderful mom, but I don't think I'm hungry..." says Ana, that gets up and goes to the bedroom.<br />
Then Rosa asks, looking at Izaque, "What happened to her?"<br />
"I don't know mom..." says Izaque worried.<br />
"You should go see what she's got," says Rosa.<br />
"Okay mom..." says Izaque, that finishes eating and goes to the bedroom.<br />
<br />
Izaque gets there and sees that Ana is passing her hands on the blade of her ax, seeing her reflection.<br />
Then the boy asks, "What's wrong, little sis?"<br />
"I'm just a little thoughtful big bro..." replies Ana, who looks at him.<br />
"Hm... Do you think he's our dad little sis?" asks Izaque.<br />
"Would that be a wild guess, big bro?" asks Ana, who looks at his brother.<br />
He thinks a little and then replies, "Maybe little sis, he didn't care for us being there."<br />
"He could trust on us enough to not worry big bro..." says Ana, that goes back to looking at the blade of her ax.<br />
Izaque gets thoughtful, he sits on the bed, the sister comes back to look at him and asks, "What do you think big bro?"<br />
<br />
"I don't know little sis, maybe it's him... But if we try to call him back home he might not accept it," answers Izaque.<br />
"And what explains him running after us, little sis?" asks Izaque, in doubt.<br />
Then Ana replies, "He could explain that to us, big bro".<br />
"Hm... I'm not sure, if you want to go, I'll go with you to protect you little sis..." says Izaque.<br />
"Thanks, big bro, you're awesome!" says Ana, who gets up and walks to Izaque, hugging him tight.<br />
Izaque then says smiling, "And well... It's boring being here at home doing nothing, hehe, I'd rather be on an adventure with you little sis".<br />
"Hehe, me too big bro, so... Let's go?" asks Ana, smiling.<br />
"Okay little sis," replies Izaque, the two walk to the kitchen, looking at their mother that was washing the dishes.<br />
"We're going on an adventure mom," says Izaque, Rosa tells him to take care of his sister.<br />
Ana then flies through the window and Izaque flies behind her, they arrive at the hole where Fred lived.<br />
<br />
The duo then enters the hole, starting to walk around the dungeon.<br />
"This dungeon is huge, he might find us first big bro, he knows this place better than us," says Ana.<br />
"Yeah, I think so, we have to be careful little sis," says Izaque.<br />
They continued walking further into the dungeon, looking for Fred.<br />
The siblings walk a little more and find Fred doing his things, fiddling with some papers.<br />
"Hey dude..." says Izaque to Fred.<br />
"Oh, you two are back," says Fred, looking at the duo.<br />
"Can we talk?" asks Ana, smiling.<br />
"Yes," replies Fred.<br />
"Is there some specific place for us to stay?" asks Ana.<br />
"I'm not sure, I got some chairs here..." replies Fred.<br />
Ana looks to Izaque and says, "It worked out better than I thought", then the two sit down.<br />
<br />
Fred looks at both of them, asking, curious, "But what do you wanna talk about?"<br />
Then Ana asks, "Do you know our mother?"<br />
"I'm not sure if I know or not...<br />
It's hard to know about this new generation of your family," replies Fred.<br />
"But you asked about her..." says Ana, in doubt.<br />
"Yeah, but I don't know her..." replies Fred.<br />
Ana looks at Izaque and says, "Do you think he's saying the truth big bro?..."<br />
"I guess so little sis," replies Izaque.<br />
"Hm... Maybe I know her," says Fred, thoughtful.<br />
"Let me see here... Mother of Izaque and Ana..." says Fred while looking at his papers, looking for something.<br />
"I found it! The name of her is Rosa," says Fred, lifting the paper.<br />
<br />
"Yeah, it's Rosa," says Izaque.<br />
"You better have weapons, strength, and courage.<br />
So you can protect your mom... Because I couldn't...<br />
I-I mean... I couldn't protect another person," says Fred, stuttering, with fear of revealing something important.<br />
"Hmm?" asks Ana, wanting to hear what Fred said again.<br />
"I couldn't protect an important person, so I ran away," replies Fred looking down.<br />
Izaque looks at Ana and then looks at Fred again, he asks, "Who was that person?"<br />
"My wife..." says Fred.<br />
Ana looks at Izaque and then asks, "Do you think we need any more proof big bro?"<br />
"I guess not little sis," says Izaque.<br />
"I'm your father!" says Fred (Darth Vader).<br />
"I knew it! Your dessert is mine little sis," says Izaque.<br />
"What do you mean big bro?" asks Ana, curious.<br />
"I made a bet with you, I was right and now your dessert is mine," says Izaque.<br />
"Aww, that's not fair big bro, I wasn't aware of that bet, I won't sleep with you then..." says Ana, who made a sulking face.<br />
"I'm just kidding little sis, hehe," says Izaque smiling, who hugs Ana.<br />
Fred laughs a little after hearing that, then smiles, seeing the two siblings together, and thinking of the past.<br />
<br />
Then Ana looks at Fred, "And why you're still here?" asks Ana.<br />
So Fred says, "I don't know, I think I didn't give up yet".<br />
"Come home with us..." says Ana in a sad voice, looking at him.<br />
"I don't know if Rosa will accept me back after what I did..." replies Fred.<br />
Then Ana asks, "And what did you do?"<br />
"I couldn't protect her, and then I left...<br />
I left her when you too were little, when your mother had twenty-two..." answers Fred.<br />
"She's forgiven us so many times, I bet she'll forgive you too," says Ana.<br />
"Yeah, no need to fear..." adds Izaque. (No need to fear, Underdog is here)<br />
<br />
Then Fred replies, "I don't know... I'm out of guts..."<br />
"We'll help you," says Ana.<br />
"Okay... All right kids..." says Fred.<br />
Ana says with an excited voice, "Let's get you home daddy!"<br />
"I'll try, thanks, kids..." Fred answers a little sad, looking at them.<br />
"Hey daddy... Did you marry mommy just to study her family?" asks Ana, curious.<br />
"I married her because I love her, she's the woman of my life!" says Fred, happy, smiling.<br />
"Well, okay then, hehe," says Ana, who holds Fred's arm.<br />
"I hope you're not afraid of heights daddy," says Ana, then she gives a short laugh.<br />
"Come here big bro, help me take him," says Ana.<br />
"Okay little sis," says Izaque, who then grabs his other arm.<br />
They lift Fred in the air and he gets scared, saying, "Wooaah!" while shaking his legs.<br />
The siblings fly low on the dungeon, they get out of it and start to fly to the house of their mother, Rosa.<br />
<br />
After some time of flying, they arrive there and land on the ground.<br />
"Are you ready daddy?" asks Ana, Izaque smiles while looking at the two.<br />
"Yeah, let's go," replies Fred, Ana knocks on the door of the house.<br />
Rosa who was holding a fruit basket opens and says, "Oh, you arrive-", Rosa drops the basket on the floor, perplexed by seeing Fred again.<br />
"Ã‰... Surprise mom!" says Ana.<br />
"I'm sorry Rosa, for leaving you..." says Fred looking down, sad.<br />
"W-Where have you been?" asks Rosa, gaping.<br />
"Out there, cataloging and registering the history of our family... Please... Forgive me Rosa..." says Fred, kneeling on the ground.<br />
"Of course I forgive you, silly! Get up!" says Ana, that runs to hug Fred.<br />
<br />
They both start crying with happiness.<br />
"Well... At least, we're sure he's not a crazy stalker, big bro," says Ana, looking at Izaque.<br />
"I agree," replies Izaque.<br />
"Oh, come here you naughty little ones!" says Fred smiling a lot, who then pulls them both into the hug and laughs.<br />
"Awww," says Rosa, finding Fred cute hugging his children.<br />
Rosa lets go of the hug and gets up, saying, "Come on in you all, dinner is ready".<br />
Izaque and Ana grab the fruits and give them to their mother to put in the basket.<br />
They all eat together as a family again, the siblings always having new adventures along with their father.<br />
Ana and Izaque loved having their father back, they were very happy.<br />
Izaque would love to visit other universes with the Infinity Gauntlet, of other stories to come, but he thinks it is too early for that.<br />
Fred Bulkan continues going to his dungeon to catalog and register the story of his family, the Bulkan family, and the Winston family.<br />
He also starts to expand his house with some logs and nails that he bought in the city of Folkloria.<br />
The man starts teaching Izaque how to use the sword and starts teaching him how to farm plants and build a house.<br />
Izaque loves to learn with his father, the father also brought his children to visit the city and see how it is.<br />
The two siblings loved to see the city, everyone, to see the king in person, who was making an announcement at the city hall.<br />
The king announced that the soldier army was needing recruits for training, and any boy who was brave enough could apply for the position.<br />
It was two of April of 1571.<br />
Izaque and Ana learned how to control more their dragon powers.<br />
They now can transform into their human form, and also back to their dragon form, being human-dragon hybrids.<br />
Izaque also practiced using his Gauntlet of Infinity, learning new powers, and creating new things, like gold coins to help his parents.<br />
More weapons to fight foes and other animals and mythological creatures, or maybe befriend them.<br />
<br />

"He could trust on us enough to not worry big bro..." says Ana, that goes back to looking at the blade of her ax.<br />
Izaque gets thoughtful, he sits on the bed.<br />
The sister comes back to look at him and asks.<br />
"What do you think big bro?"<br />
<br />
"I don't know little sis, maybe it's him... But if we try to call him back home he might not accept it," answers Izaque.<br />
"And what explains him running after us, little sis?" asks Izaque in doubt.<br />
Then Ana replies, "He could explain that to us, big bro".<br />
"Hmm, I'm not sure, if you want to go, I'll go with you to protect you, little sis..." says Izaque.<br />
"Thanks, big bro, you're awesome," says Ana, who gets up and walks to Izaque, hugging him.<br />
Izaque then says smiling, "And also, it's boring being here at home doing nothing, I'd rather be with you little sis".<br />
"Hehe, me too big bro, so, let's go?" asks Ana, smiling.<br />
"Yeah little sis," replies Izaque.<br />
"We're gonna go on an adventure mom," says Izaque from the bedroom, Rosa tells him to take care of his sister.<br />
Ana then flies through the window and Izaque flies behind her.<br />
They arrive at the hole where Fred lived.<br />
<br />
The duo then enters inside the hole.<br />
"This dungeon is huge, he might find us first big bro," says Ana.<br />
"Yeah, I think so, we have to be careful little sis," says Izaque.<br />
They continued walking further into the dungeon.<br />
The siblings walk a little more and find Fred doing his things.<br />
"Hey dude," says Izaque to Fred.<br />
"Oh, you two came back," says Fred.<br />
"Can we talk?" asks Ana smiling.<br />
"Yes," replies Fred.<br />
"Is there some specific place for us to stay?" asks Ana.<br />
"I'm not sure, I got some chairs here..." replies Fred.<br />
Ana looks to Izaque and says, "It worked out better than I thought".<br />
<br />
Fred looks at both of them, asking.<br />
"But what do you wanna talk about?"<br />
Then Ana asks, "Do you know our mother?"<br />
"I'm not sure if I know or not...<br />
It's hard to know about this new generation of your family," replies Fred.<br />
"But you asked about her..." says Ana in doubt.<br />
"Yeah, but I don't know her..." replies Fred.<br />
Ana looks at Izaque and says, "Do you think he's saying the truth big bro?..."<br />
"I guess so, little sis," replies Izaque.<br />
"Hmm... Maybe I know her," says Fred, thoughtful.<br />
"Let me see here, mother of Izaque and Ana..." says Fred while looking at his papers.<br />
"I found it! The name of her is Rosa," says Fred, lifting the paper.<br />
<br />
"Yeah, it's Rosa," says Izaque.<br />
"You better have weapons, strength, and courage.<br />
So you can protect your mom because I couldn't.<br />
I-I mean... I couldn't protect another person," says Fred, stuttering, with fear of revealing something important.<br />
"Hmm?" asks Ana, wanting to hear what Fred said again.<br />
"I couldn't protect an important person, so I ran away," replies Fred looking down.<br />
Izaque looks at Ana and then looks at Fred again, he asks, "Who was that person?"<br />
"My wife..." says Fred.<br />
Ana looks at Izaque and then asks, "Do you think we need any more proof, big bro?"<br />
"I guess not, little sis," says Izaque.<br />
"I'm your father!" says Fred (Darth Vader).<br />
"I knew it, your dessert is mine little sis," says Izaque.<br />
"What do you mean big bro?" asks Ana.<br />
"I made a bet with you, I was right and now your dessert is mine," says Izaque.<br />
"Aww, that's not fair big bro, I won't sleep with you then," says Ana, who made a sad face, but then smiled maliciously.<br />
"I'm just kidding little sis," says Izaque, who hugs Ana.<br />
Fred laughs a little after hearing that.<br />
<br />
Then Ana looks at Fred.<br />
"And why you're still here?" asks Ana.<br />
So Fred says, "I don't know, I don't think I've given up yet".<br />
"Come home with us..." says Ana in a sad voice, looking at the man.<br />
"I don't know if Rosa will accept me back after what I did..." replies Fred.<br />
Then Ana asks, "And what did you do?"<br />
"I couldn't protect her, and then I left..." answers Fred.<br />
"She's forgiven us so many times, I bet she'll forgive you too," says Ana.<br />
"Yeah, no need to fear..." adds Izaque. (No need to fear, Underdog is here)<br />
<br />
Then Fred replies, "I don't know... I'm out of guts..."<br />
"We'll help you," says Ana.<br />
"Okay... All right kids..." says Fred.<br />
Ana says with an excited voice, "Let's get you home!... Dad..."<br />
"I'll try, thanks, kids..." Fred answers a little sad.<br />
Ana holds Fred's arm and says, "I hope you're not afraid of heights dad," then she gives a short laugh.<br />
"Come here big bro, help me take him," says Ana.<br />
"Okay little sis," says Izaque, who then grabs his other arm.<br />
They lift Fred in the air and he gets scared, saying, "Wooaah!" while shaking his legs.<br />
The siblings fly low on the dungeon, they get out of it and start to fly to the house of their mother, Rosa.<br />
<br />
After some time of flying, they arrive there and land on the ground.<br />
"Are you ready dad?" asks Ana.<br />
Izaque smiles while looking at the two.<br />
"Yeah," replies Fred.<br />
Ana knocks on the door of the house.<br />
Rosa who was holding a fruit basket opens and says, "Oh, you arrive-", Rosa drops the basket and is perplexed by seeing Fred.<br />
"Eh... Surprise mom!" says Ana.<br />
"I'm sorry Rosa, for leaving..." says Fred looking down, sad.<br />
"W-Where have you been?" asks Rosa, gaping.<br />
"Out there, cataloging and registering the history of our family... Please forgive me, Rosa," says Fred, kneeling on the ground.<br />
"Of course I forgive you, dummy! Get up," says Ana that runs to hug Fred.<br />
<br />
They both start crying with happiness.<br />
"At least, we're sure he's not a crazy stalker, big bro," says Ana.<br />
Then Izaque replies, "Yeah, I agree with you, little sis".<br />
"Oh, come here you naughty little ones!" says Fred smiling a lot, who then pulls them both into the hug and laughs.<br />
"Awww," says Rosa finding Fred cute hugging his children.<br />
Rosa lets go of the hug and get up, saying, "Come on in, dinner is ready".<br />
Izaque and Ana grab the fruits and give them to their mother to put in the basket.<br />
They all eat together as a family, and always have new adventures along with their father, Ana and Izaque loved having their father back, they were very happy.<br />
Izaque would love to visit other universes with the Infinity Gauntlet, of other stories to come, but he thinks it is too early for that.<br />
Fred Bulkan continues going to his dungeon to catalog and register the things of his family, the Bulkan family, and the Winston family.<br />
He also starts to expand his house with some logs and nails that he bought in the city of Folkloria.<br />
The man starts teaching Izaque how to use the sword and starts teaching him how to farm plants and build a house.<br />
Izaque loves to learn with his father, he also brings his children to visit the city and see how it is.<br />
The two siblings loved to see the city, everyone, to see the king in person, who was making an announcement at the city hall.<br />
It was two of April of 1571.<br />
<br />
