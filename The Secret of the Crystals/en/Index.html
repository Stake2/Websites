		I started writing this story on 02/04/2020.<br />
<br />
I got inspired by this album of music here, it is very good:<br />
Soundtrack: Sharks - Maelstrom EP.<br />
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9NU4luuCb0" target="_blank" class="text_green_water text_hover_green_water">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9NU4luuCb0</a><br />
Songs: Out My Head, Amethyst, Maelstrom, Mermaid, Coral<br />
<br />
I got inspired by the album above, and a guy wrote a comment on the SoundCloud page of the song called "<a href="https://soundcloud.com/rushdownrecs/sharks-coral/comments/686621514" target="_blank">Sharks - Coral</a>" of the album.<br />
His username is TimeShocked, URL is vinod-mahadik-806863844, he commented at 0:44 of the song.<br />
<br />
This is his comment:<br />
To conclude the EP, I made a story that summarizes the EP. There was a girl named Anna who has met a classmate that can read her mind and Anna seems to never notice it. After a few days, Anna got suspicious of her classmate having one "?". "How can she read my mind?". She decided to confront her and tell her to get "OUT MY HEAD". After she did that, her classmate stopped reading her mind. But they were still friends. After that they went to the beach after a few hours, Anna saw an "AMETHYST" glowing at the shallow shore. Anna went to get it and it was hard to get it off the ground. After getting it off the ground, Anna noticed that she was getting sucked in the ocean, but it was not the ocean, It was a "MAELSTROM"! After getting sucked in Anna was shocked by the fact that she can breathe underwater and was admiring the magical reefs of the oceans glowing. After some time she encountered a "MERMAID" that looked nice and gave her shelter. After that, she lived in the "CORAL" reefs forever.<br />
<br />
I liked that comment a lot, it was a good story, even if it was small.<br />
Then I got inspired to write something, so I started to write this story.<br />
I changed the character name from Anna to Ana, and in the middle of writing it, I changed the character name to my current girlfriend's name at the time.<br />
I always imagined Ana as Lapis Lazuli from the cartoon Steven Universe in her debut or first form, not the mean or nice one.<br />
She is Lapis Lazuli, the left one from the story cover.<br />
<br /><img class="image_size border_4px border_color_light_cyan border_radius_8_cent box_shadow_black" src="https://thestake2.netlify.app/Images/Images/The Secret of the Crystals/Lapis Lazuli.png" style="max-width: 50%;" /><br /><br />
<br />
Also, a character that appears in this story, is a little inspired by Maui from the Disney movie called Moana.<br />
The fact that he can turn into a humanoid bird and a hawk-like bird.<br />
And there's also an inspiration from the space exploration game called "No Man's Sky", I love that game, and I would love to explore space with a spaceship.<br />
<br />
So this story is both inspired by and contains elements from:<br />
My story "Desert Island"<br />
The Disney movie "Moana"<br />
The Cartoon Network cartoon "Steven Universe"<br />
The album "Maelstrom EP" from the artist "Sharks"<br />
The comment of "Vinod Mahadik" on the "Sharks - Coral" song on SoundCloud<br />
And the game "No Man's Sky"<br />
<br />
I wrote this story for some time, well, one year, from 2020 to now, and did not post it, I kept writing it.<br />
And I think that I want to start posting it, so I am writing this introduction here, I am writing on 12/07/2021.<br />
I am also slicing up this story into chapters, the source of it is a big text file with 1.157 lines and two hundred thousand words.<br />
Well, let's get to the story, shall we?<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
There was a girl named Ana, she was soaring high in the sky, it was in the afternoon.<br />
She was thinking about some bad things about death and tragedy because she was close to the Clouds of Madness.<br />
It made people think bad things, that was the bad effect of being there.<br />
Some said that the wars and fights between people were caused by the storms that those clouds brought.<br />
Suddenly, her necklace broke and she fell on the beach of an island that was close there.<br />
The fall was too high and she got hurt, was knocked unconscious, and slept on the cold sand.<br />
<br />
She woke up and looked forward, her face was covered in sand and she cleaned it, her beautiful blue wings of fairy did not work anymore, she flapped them and little to no glitter came off them.<br />
Ana was out of magic power because her necklace broke, she needed to find something in the forest to fix it and needed to cure herself too, she was hurt and bleeding a little.<br />
She started walking in the forest, it was still afternoon, she grabbed some vines in the trees and tied up them in her bruise which was hurting.<br />
<br />
Then grabbed some more vines and started to make a little rope with them, she removed the rope of the necklace and pocketed the pink jewel.<br />
Ana made a thread with the vines and picked some tree resin from the pine trees that were close to there.<br />
She found charcoal from a bonfire that had gone out and made it into charcoal powder.<br />
Then made she prepared a campfire and left it burning, picked up some mud, and made two pots with it.<br />
She found a metal filter left in there, grabbed it, and melted the resin she got from the trees with the help of the mud pot, then filtered the impurities from the resin into another jar.<br />
Ana added the charcoal powder into the mix and stirred it up, she just finished making a natural glue with tree resin.<br />
She melted it again because it was already dry and fixed her jewel which was broken in half, it began shining with a blue light.<br />
The wings of Ana appeared again on her back, glowing a lot in blue and releasing glitter, she flapped them a little, her pink jewel shining in the same color.<br />
<br />
Ana started flying normally and decided to leave that island, she continued flying to where she was going before she lost her wings.<br />
She was a fairy, that lived in the Crystal Lands, she left home because she thought that she did not belong there and because she was afraid.<br />
Ana was flying as the wind blew her face, she was crying a little because she missed her home, she thought about her friends and family there.<br />
Then, a bird-like creature began flying beside her, it asked where she was going, she said that she was just traveling and flying through the world.<br />
The creature said its name was Tod, he was a Kódek, a creature that is like a bird, a hawk, and lives in the Mountains of Aris, close to the Volcanoes of Death island.<br />
Tod said that it was dangerous there because it was close to the Volcanoes of Death, some times one of the volcanoes erupted and lava invaded their houses.<br />
She said she missed home, Tod said he missed his too, he said he was going to travel back home, to see his family, and advised Ana to do the same.<br />
Ana replied to Tod, wishing him good luck, wanting him to be safe, Tod wished good luck for Ana too.<br />
<br />
After some time flying, it was night already, and it was raining everywhere, but Ana kept flying even if it was a little cold.<br />
Maelstroms formed in the ocean and you could see little islands from far away.<br />
Ana liked to see dark clouds and a huge and strong storm like that, she liked hearing the sounds of the thunders.<br />
She did not have a map in her hands, but she knew where home was, her necklace with a pink jewel showed her the way, made her feel where home is, it was given by her mother.<br />
It was a great gift, it made her think of the memories she had with her mother, it made her happy.<br />
Ana was flying and flying, in the direction that she felt that Crystal Lands was, trying to return home.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
After a little while, she arrived there, it was a crystal island with a lot of crystals in its ground, growing from inside the ground, the friends and sisters of Ana were there to greet her.<br />
No fairy knew about how the crystals appeared there or their origin, Ana was curious about that, she wanted to discover the secret of the crystals.<br />
Everyone was worried about her because she disappeared out of nowhere, Ana arrived there soaked in water.<br />
Her sisters, Lindsay, and Panda asked why she left home, she replied that it was because she did not feel like she belonged there and because she was afraid.<br />
Lindsay was a redhead with yellow wings and red eyes, she was very kind and the older sister of Ana, she had twenty.<br />
She told her to not worry about it, as fairies are always kind, they will not do anything that other fairies do not want.<br />
Panda told her to not worry about that, they would protect her and always care for her, that she belonged there, Panda had eighteen.<br />
Her sisters said that she could travel to other places if she wanted, she could even live in those places.<br />
She was free and did not need to stay there if she did not want to.<br />
But she was always welcome there, and they would receive her with open arms.<br />
<br />
Ana walked through the Crystal Lands and arrived at the hut of her mother.<br />
Lindsay and Panda walked with her, her mother was there, she was called Jena, and had thirty-nine.<br />
She had nineteen when she had Lindsay, twenty when she had Ana, and twenty-one when she had Panda.<br />
Jena was worried about Ana because she disappeared without saying why.<br />
Jena was eating at the table of the kitchen, in the wooden made hut.<br />
The sisters of Ana started to eat at the table too, they were eating bread and milk.<br />
Ana apologized for leaving the island without telling why, she hugged her mother and Jena said it was okay.<br />
Ana said she was going to her room to rest a bit, she walked there and closed the door.<br />
The fairy thought about the crystals, about their secrets, and where they came from.<br />
She thought about where she could learn about their origin and their history.<br />
Ana was thinking about the land of the Stone Ogres, the land of the Soul Wasps, the ones that knew how to remove their soul from their body.<br />
Their body was a soul, they did not have a physical body, Ana thought that they could know something since they lived for so many years.<br />
The Soul Wasps lived in the Jar of Petals, an island close to the Volcanoes of Death, it haves sand, dirt, and tall mountains, it also has some crystals.<br />
The Stone Ogres lived in Tartanium Mocks, with a lot of rocks, trees, and also tall mountains.<br />
<br />
The birds were singing, making their noises, the water was hitting the shore, a tropical atmosphere with beautiful and relaxing sounds, perfect to sleep.<br />
Ana had a tough day, flying, crying, and having her necklace broken, she needed some rest, she was not used to being at home, she was used to sleeping in beds made of wood and mud.<br />
She is used to living in nature with wooden beds and natural things, campfires, fruits, and meat that she hunts and cooks.<br />
It was weird to be laid down on a comfortable bed with a mattress and a pillow.<br />
She slept for some time while listening to the birds, toucans, and the water hitting the shore, it was so relaxing.<br />
<br />
After some hours, she woke up, and it was afternoon, Jena left the house for a while to gather some food and fruits.<br />
The fairies lived in peace there, collecting and growing their food and making their furniture.<br />
Lindsay and Panda were playing some ball out there in the village while flying.<br />
Ana wanted to travel a little more, she wanted to be alone on a desert island, do nature things again.<br />
Ana left the house of her mother and told Lindsay and Panda that she was going to travel far again.<br />
Lindsay and Panda said okay and said that they were going to tell her mother, they hugged Ana tight.<br />
"We gonna miss you, Ana, I love you," said Lindsay, hugging Ana tight.<br />
"Me too Ana, I love you," said Panda.<br />
"I love you both," said Ana, almost crying, she gave a kiss on the cheek of both of them.<br />
Lindsay told Jena that maybe Ana was going to the Mountains of Aris.<br />
<br />
She left flying, Ana thought about that bird, Tod, the Kódek, she wanted to see him again, she wonders if he came back home and arrived safely there.<br />
Ana knew a lot of islands and places to go, in this world, this planet that she lived in, she is used to traveling a lot and knows the world a lot.<br />
The fairy had a map of the world inside her mind, she knew the Clouds of Madness, Crystal Lands, Mountains of Aris, and the Volcanoes of Death.<br />
She thinks Tod spoke a little about the Mountains of Aris, close to the Volcanoes of Death, she wanted to go there to visit him.

		<h4 id="chapter_2_text" class="text_size unselectable  text_green_water" style="text-align: left;">
		Ana was still flying, she arrived close to the Mountains of Aris, it was an island with lots of crystals of various colors that came from inside the ground.<br />
They were very beautiful, there were red, blue, cyan, pink, orange, yellow, white, black, and green crystals.<br />
They were shiny and pointy, Ana liked the sight of them, she wanted to get close to feel the crystals with her hand.<br />
She flew more and landed at the sand, a Kódek greeted her, asking who she was.<br />
"I am the friend of a Kódek called Tod, do you know him?" asked Ana.<br />
"Ah, Tod, yes, I think he went to an island to the north, he never stays home, sometimes I get worried about him.<br />
Sometimes I think he is gonna get into danger," said the Kódek.<br />
"Oh, thanks, I'm gonna go there to talk with him, to check if he's alright, okay?" said Ana.<br />
"Okay, thank you, my dear, what is your name?" asked the Kódek.<br />
"My name is Ana, what is yours?" asked Ana.<br />
"My name's Sophia, I am the mother of Tod..." said the Kódek.<br />
"Oh, I'll make sure he is safe Sophia! Don't worry, I'll bring your son home," said Ana, excited and brave, closing her fist.<br />
"Thank you so much, my dear, I'm so happy right now," said Sophia, she flew and hugged Ana, Ana hugged her back.<br />
Then Ana waved goodbye to Sophia and started flying to the island to the north.<br />
<br />
She was flying high in the sky, it started raining, she was with her pink necklace.<br />
Ana was catching the rain, it was a little cold, "I might catch a cold here," thought her.<br />
So she held her necklace and created a bubble of fire around her, protecting her from the cold rain.<br />
Her mother has taught her how to use the magic of the necklace, it was very powerful and had a lot of spells.<br />
Ana continued flying to the island of the north, searching for Tod.<br />
She thought about the mystery of the crystals, what was their origin story, how they appeared in that land.<br />
Suddenly, the rain stopped, a beautiful rainbow appeared in the sky, and the sun appeared again.<br />
Ana looked at that and thought that it was very beautiful and had a wonderful view.<br />
She continued flying with her blue wings, searching for the island of the north.<br />
<br />
Ana saw an island there, with palm trees, a forest, and sand around the island, it was morning.<br />
She thought that it was that island, so she flew close to it and landed on the sand.<br />
Ana walked around the island looking for Tod, looking at the trees, the sand, the dirt.<br />
The fairy found a humanoid bird there, a bird with the shape of a human, she looked at it with curiosity.<br />
"Hello... Who are you?..." asked Ana, looking at the creature.<br />
"Hey... I'm a Kódek, I guess you never saw a Kódek like this right?" asked the Kódek, looking at Ana.<br />
"Yeah... I never saw one like this, can I ask your name?" asked Ana.<br />
"Yes... My name is Tod, I'm sorry for making you see me like this... I'm ugly right?" asked Tod, feeling bad for showing that side of him to Ana.<br />
"No, you're beautiful Tod, I don't think you're ugly! You're even cooler than before!" replied Ana, looking at Tod.<br />
"Really?... Thanks, Ana, that means a lot to me, it is that the Kódeks don't show their humanoid form to everyone...<br />
That is a secret among us Kódeks and no one knows about that, so please, don't tell anyone that you saw this, okay?" asked Tod.<br />
"I won't tell anyone, I promise... So... How do you turn into a human or a humanoid bird?" asked Ana.<br />
"I have human blood, all Kódeks have, the story is that long ago, an evil race ruled the planet.<br />
They cursed us, and turned us into birds, we were humans before.<br />
Then, a great magician helped us, he cured us, and we could turn into humans again.<br />
But we didn't accept that, we got used to being birds, and this secret of us having human blood was hidden.<br />
So I always go to islands where there's no one, so I can turn into a humanoid bird and be myself because this is how I feel I am.<br />
I can even turn into a human," says Tod, transforming himself into a human, "See?"<br />
"That is awesome Tod! I wish I could turn into a bird, a cool bird like you, and your humanoid bird form is cool too.<br />
I'm sorry you can't turn into a humanoid bird or a human in front of others... But you turned into that in front of me.<br />
And you didn't run or try to hide when you saw me coming... Why?" asked Ana.<br />
"Because I thought you would understand... I thought you wouldn't have a bias with me... And you wouldn't judge me by my appearance," replied Tod.<br />
"Oh, I feel happy knowing you think that of me, of course, I would never judge you by your appearance..." said Ana.<br />
"Hehe, I feel happy having a friend like you Ana," said Tod, smiling at Ana.<br />
"Really? We're friends?" asked Ana, surprised, smiling a little.<br />
"Of course we're friends silly," said Tod, smiling at Ana, he walked close to her in his human form, hugging her.<br />
Ana accepted the hug and smiled, "Thanks Tod, you're a great friend," said her.<br />
(This is how the humanoid version of Tod looks like.)<br />
<br /><img class="image_size border_4px border_color_light_cyan border_radius_8_cent box_shadow_black" src="https://thestake2.netlify.app/Images/Images/The Secret of the Crystals/Humanoid Kódek.jpg" style="max-width: 50%;" /><br /><br />
(The hawk at the right of the No Man's Sky Atlas Plumbob on the story cover is the bird version of Tod.)<br />
<br />
"So... What you're doing here on this island Tod?" asked Ana.<br />
"I'm just building nature stuff, building houses, campfires, hunting, and stuff, I love to do nature crafts," said Tod.<br />
"Really? I love to do that too, it is a great passion for me, we should do it together sometime!" said Ana, excited, smiling at Tod.<br />
"Of course, surviving is always more fun with a friend," said Tod, smiling.<br />
So Ana walked around the island, looking at the trees and the sand.<br />
"Did you build something here already?" asked Ana, looking at Tod in his human form.<br />
"No, I just arrived here, it's been some minutes, I was thinking about what to build first, and then you arrived, hehe," said Tod smiling.<br />
"Hehe, should we do an ax?" asked Ana, looking at him.<br />
"That sounds great!" said Tod.<br />
Then they looked for a good tree to make an ax handle, they found a small stone that looked like a knife.<br />
Tod grabbed that stone and got a thick tree branch.<br />
He grabbed a big stone and walked close to the water, he soaked the stone with water and walked close to the forest, sitting there.<br />
Ana followed him, looking at what he made, Tod started carving the small stone to make it sharper, like a knife.<br />
Then he walked close to a good tree and started cutting it with the help of the knife and the thick tree branch.<br />
After that, Ana and he grabbed the log together and walked close to the exit of the forest, leaving the log there.<br />
Ana grabbed the knife and the thick tree branch, cutting the log in half.<br />
She started making a hole in the half log to put a sharp stone inside it, then she gave the knife and tree branch to Tod.<br />
Tod made the same as Ana, making a hole in the other half log to put a sharp stone inside it.<br />
<br />
They both walked to the forest to search for large stones, rectangular stones.<br />
The two found two rectangular stones and brought them to the place where the half logs were.<br />
Ana started carving the rectangular stone with the big wet stone, shaping it to look like an ax blade.<br />
Then she left the wet stone there, grabbed her ax handle and her ax blade, and waited for Tod to finish his blade.<br />
Tod grabbed the rectangular stone he got and carved it using the wet stone.<br />
Ana looked at him, and the things they already made together, she was happy to survive with him, it was cool to do nature things with someone else.<br />
Then Tod and Ana grabbed her parts of their ax.<br />
They both grabbed the thick tree branch and started putting the ax blade made of stone inside the hole in the ax handle.<br />
After some minutes, they both finished making two axes with sharp stones as the blades.<br />
They were happy and shouted excitedly.<br />
The two grabbed apples to eat, they ate them and smiled at each other.<br />
"What about we make a campfire and some mud jars?" asked Ana.<br />
"I think that's a great idea, Ana," replied Tod.<br />
Then Ana looked for a big stone in the forest, she found it and brought it close to where Tod was.<br />
There was a small river in the forest, it had flowing water and mud.<br />
Ana and Tod walked to that river, they started grabbing some mud and bringing it close to the big stone.<br />
Ana made one jar of mud and Tod too, they started cutting trees and getting tree branches to make a fire.<br />
<br />
They also grab some dry leaves to use as a wick, they sit on the ground together and arrange the sticks, branches, and leaves like a campfire.<br />
The two cut three holes in a stick and put it on top of the dry leaves.<br />
Then Ana puts one stick on one of the holes of the other stick, turning it against the other until smoke comes out of the dry leaves.<br />
After the smoke appears, Ana removes the two sticks from the top of the leaves and picks them up with her hands, blowing them gently to make a fire.<br />
Then, after the fire appears, Ana leaves the dry leaves on top of the sticks and branches arranged like a campfire.<br />
They keep adding dry branches and sticks to the fire to fuel it.<br />
Then Tod gets the big dry stone and places it close to the fire, he gets the two jars of mud and places them on top of the stone for them to dry.<br />
The jars dry and Ana gets them, she fills both of them with water from the ocean.<br />
"Hey, should we do a furnace in here?" asks Tod.<br />
"Yes, that way we can cook food on top of it, and boil water too, we can't drink water from the ocean, we have to boil it," said Ana.<br />
Then Tod started getting some mud from the small river that was inside the forest.<br />
He brought the mud close to the campfire and started making bricks with it, leaving them close to the fire to dry.<br />
Then, with the help of Ana, Tod manages to make a furnace in the fire.<br />
They can fuel the fire from below, and the fire comes out from the top.<br />
Ana makes a mud lid for the jar, she puts it on top of the furnace for it to dry.<br />
After some minutes, Tod gets one jar of water and puts the lid on top of it, then he leaves the jar on top of the furnace.<br />
The water starts to boil, Ana and Tod waited for a while, they grabbed two thick tree branches and carefully removed the hot jar from the top of the furnace.<br />
<br />
The two waited for the water to get chill, Ana made a mud cup for her and Tod too, they left the cups on top of the furnace for them to dry.<br />
Then, they grabbed the chill water from the jar, and poured it into their cups, sat in the sand, drinking it while looking at each other.<br />
Ana and Tod looked at everything they built together, the jars, the campfire, the axes, they were so happy.<br />
"I never knew you liked to do nature things, it is very interesting... This interest that you have, hehe," said Tod smiling.<br />
"Hehe, I never knew you liked to do nature crafts too, it is a very good thing, relaxing.<br />
It makes you forget about the problems and stop thinking about them, that's why I like it.<br />
I feel like I am at home here, it is what I love to do," says Ana, smiling at Tod.<br />
"Look at everything we made together, hehe, I'm so proud of it!" said Tod, looking at the axes, the campfire, and the jars.<br />
"Me too! It is fun surviving together, I never shared this interest with anyone, it is good to have someone to share it," said Ana.<br />
"I agree with you, it is very good to share it, sometimes I feel so lonely surviving alone... I wish I could have someone there with me.<br />
And look at what I have now... You! Hehe, thanks Ana," said Tod, smiling at Ana.<br />
"No problem, hehe, I always appreciate some good company," said Ana.<br />
"So... What should we do now?" asked Tod.<br />
"Can we fish something?" asked Ana.<br />
"Yea, I think that's a great idea!" said Tod.<br />
"We have to make a spear first," said Ana.<br />
"Yes, let's make it then," said Tod, who started looking for a good thin tree to cut, he found one and cut it down.<br />
Tod then walked close to the fire and inserted the tip of the spear into the fire to char the blunt tip.<br />
After that, he grabbed the spear with its tip on fire and scraped it in a rock to sharpen it.<br />
Then he sat on the ground and grabbed a piece of wood, Tod polished the tip of the spear with it.<br />
"So, who should go first?" asked Tod, looking at Ana.<br />
"I don't know, you can go first if you want, I never used a spear," replied Ana.<br />
"Okay, can I teach you how to use it?" asked Tod.<br />
"Of course, I would love some help!" said Ana, smiling, exciting to learn how to use the spear.<br />
Then Tod and Ana walked close to the water, there were some fish close to the shore.<br />
Tod gave Ana the spear and showed her how to aim it, he told her to wait for the water to be calm and the fish to calm down, then she could shoot.<br />
She waited for some seconds and shot the spear at a fish, she managed to catch it, Ana shouted excitedly.<br />
"You got it! On the first try, hehe," said Tod, smiling at Ana, proud of her.<br />
"Yes! Thanks for teaching me, Tod," said Ana.<br />
"No problem, hehe," said Tod.<br />
<br />
Then Tod caught another, they started grabbing some mud on the river of the forest to make two short walls on the sides of the furnace.<br />
After that, they walked around the forest, trying to find trees with a Y in the middle of the branch.<br />
They cut two of those trees and brought them close to the furnace, then they inserted those branches inside the short walls of mud.<br />
The two found another thin stick and placed it on top of the other two branches shaped like a Y.<br />
Ana grabbed one fish and cleaned it, removing scales with the stone that looked like a knife and removing the things inside of it.<br />
Then she grabbed the stick from the top of the two branches and started to put the fish on the stick.<br />
The fire was getting a little bit low, Tod walked to the forest to grab more wood and sticks.<br />
He returned and started refueling the fire, Ana placed the stick with the fish on top of the two sticks shaped like a Y.<br />
The fish started to cook, Ana and Tod waited patiently, looking at the fish.<br />
Ana got up to catch a banana in a tree, she grabbed it and ate it.<br />
Tod looked up to the sky and noticed it was afternoon, only some hours left to be night.<br />
After waiting some minutes, the fish was cooked, Tod removed it from the stick and said for Ana to hold it.<br />
He grabbed a large stone and walked close to where Ana was, he left the stone on the ground and grabbed the fish.<br />
Tod placed the fish on top of the stone and cut it in half, removing the bones and thorns.<br />
They both started to eat the fish, smiling at each other, the fish tasted delicious even if it did not have salt or spices.<br />
They cooked the other fish and ate it too.<br />
<br />
Ana was very happy there, she did not think about home, about the crystals, she just enjoyed the moment for what it was.<br />
She was happy to survive and build things together with Tod, it was very fun.<br />
"Hey, Tod, I loved to build this with you, it was so exciting!" said Ana, smiling.<br />
"Hehe, I'm happy that you think that, Ana, it was fun to survive along with you," said Tod, smiling too.<br />
"So... Can we go home?" asked Ana.<br />
"Why do you want to go home?" asked Tod.<br />
"It is because your mother is worried about you, she didn't know where you'd gone, you just disappeared out of nowhere," replied Ana.<br />
"Oh... My mom is always worried about me, I keep leaving home without saying anything..." said Tod, looking down, a little sad.<br />
"Me too... They're always worried about me too..." said Ana.<br />
"Really?... Hmm..." said Tod, "It was good to survive and build things with you, Ana, thanks, hehe, let's go back home? I'll show you where I live".<br />
"Sure! I would love for you to show me the place," said Ana, smiling at Tod.<br />
Then Ana activated her wings and Tod turned into a hawk-like bird again.<br />
Ana and Tod grabbed a banana from a tree, they started flying low on the island, looking at the campfire, the furnace, stones, axes, knife-like stones, the spear.

		They started flying, Ana was following Tod because he knew the way to the Mountains of Aris, his home.<br />
Ana was looking at the sunset, it was very beautiful, the ocean was moving a little because of the wind, some fish jumped off the water and came back inside it.<br />
There were birds close to Ana and Tod, one bird looked at Tod with some curiosity, asking itself if Tod was a real bird or not.<br />
After some time flying, Ana and Tod arrived at the Mountains of Aris, Sophia was there on the shore of the beach, looking at them.<br />
They both landed at the sand and Sophia looked at Tod, smiling, happy to have her son back.<br />
"Thank you so much, Ana, for bringing my son back, I was very worried," said Sophia, smiling while looking at Ana, she hugged Tod tight.<br />
"I'm sorry for worrying you, mom," said Tod, looking sad at Sophia.<br />
"It's okay my dear, let's eat, food is ready," said Sophia, starting to walk to the village of the Kódeks.<br />
"Can Ana stay, mom?" asked Tod.<br />
"Of course, son, she is welcome here," said Sophia, smiling at Ana.<br />
"Come on," said Tod smiling lightly while looking at Ana.<br />
The trio started walking to the village of the Kódeks.<br />
Ana looked at the crystals and the Kódeks of the village, everyone walking around and doing stuff.<br />
Sophia started walking to the canteen, Tod, and Ana following her.<br />
They arrived at the canteen, Ana and Tod sat together at a table, Sophia brought some food for them, they started to eat together.<br />
"Here is very good, at the Mountains of Aris, it is a good place to spend some time," said Tod, looking at Ana.<br />
"Yeah, I agree, here is very good Tod, hehe," said Ana, smiling while looking at Tod.<br />
"Hey, Ana, is there anything you're interested in? Like, learning something new..." asked Tod while eating sometimes.<br />
"Yes, I wanted to discover the mystery of the crystals, I and my race doesn't know how they appeared on the ground or what is their origin," said Ana.<br />
"Oh, we know the mystery of them, but people here don't care about it too much, it's too mundane for them.<br />
We already use the crystals in a way, but I want you to discover by yourself, hehe.<br />
Take a visit to our library, probably there's a book with the origin story of the crystals, but we have a lot of books, hehe," said Tod, smiling.<br />
"Okay, thanks, Tod, I'll take a look later, thank you for receiving me here," said Ana.<br />
"No problem, Ana, you're a friend to me, is always good to have you around," said Tod, smiling gently at Ana.<br />
"Hehe, thanks," replied Ana, smiling too.<br />
They both finished eating, Sophia said she was going to sleep a little at her hut, Ana thanked them for receiving her there and waved her hand.<br />
Tod said that he was going to play some ball with the kids in the center of the village.<br />
"Go there if you need anything, Ana," said Tod, smiling.<br />
"Thanks, Tod," said Ana, smiling.<br />
<br />
Then Ana started walking in the village, she asked a Kódek where the library was, he pointed her the way.<br />
She started flying to the library, Ana arrived there and flew high in the library, she picked up four books to read.<br />
The fairy sat at one table in the library and started reading, she was reading a book of the story of the Kódeks, maybe there was something about the crystals there.<br />
She grabbed some fruits from the canteen some minutes ago, before she, Tod, and Sophia ate, she left those fruits close to her on the table in case she became hungry.<br />
The book told the story of the Kódeks, their secrets, how they lived, how they arrived at the Mountains of Aris.<br />
Ana looked to her right, there was a Soul Wasp there, reading a book, she had orange hair and an orange body, her body was shining.<br />
(I imagine the Orange Soul Wasp being the Flame Princess from the cartoon Adventure Time, but with fairy wings and a shining body like a soul.)<br />
Ana thought that she was so beautiful, so shiny, she liked how the Soul Wasps looked, they looked like angels.<br />
Then Ana continued reading her book, the Soul Wasp flew close to her, she looked at the book that Ana was reading.<br />
"Hey, what are you reading?" asked the Soul Wasp.<br />
"Oh, hey," said Ana, getting a little surprised, she did not see the Soul Wasp coming close to her, "I'm reading the story of the Kódeks".<br />
"Oh, that's interesting, they have a pretty great and rich story, I liked to read it," said the Soul Wasp.<br />
"Hehe, yeah, I agree... Are you reading something?" asked Ana.<br />
"Yes, I'm reading a book that tells about the Soul Wasps and the Fairies," replied the Soul Wasp.<br />
"Oh, that sounds interesting, can I read it too?" asked Ana.<br />
"Of course! You're a fairy right?" asked the Soul Wasp.<br />
"Yes, I'm a fairy," replied Ana.<br />
"Oh, I always thought Fairies were quite cute, their wings are so cute and beautiful, ehehe," said the Soul Wasp.<br />
"Hehe, thanks, I always thought Soul Wasps were cute too, their body is really beautiful, their light.<br />
The way they shine, it is marvelous, astounding to look at," said Ana, smiling to the Soul Wasp, a little flushed.<br />
"Hehe, I'm happy that you think that, thanks," said the Soul Wasp, smiling while being a little flushed.<br />
"Maybe we can switch books if you want, I would like to read the story of the Kódeks too, again, hehe," said the Soul Wasp.<br />
"Okay, that sounds good, can I ask your name?" asked Ana.<br />
"Yes, my name is Rose," replied the Soul Wasp.<br />
"My name is Ana," said Ana.<br />
"Okay... I'll continue reading my book, tell me when you wanna read it okay?" asked Rose.<br />
"Okay, thanks, Rose," said Ana, smiling at her.<br />
Rose walked back to her chair and continued reading the book that tells about the Soul Wasps and the Fairies.<br />
Ana continued reading the book of the story of the Kódeks.<br />
<br />
Ana looked at Rose and asked, "Hey, Rose, do you know anything about the crystals?"<br />
"Yes, actually, I already read about them in here, it was the reason why I wanted to go here, it's because the Kódeks know the secret of the crystals," said Rose, getting up and walking close to Ana.<br />
"The chapter where they tell about the crystals is the fourth chapter of the book, on page one hundred thirteen," said Rose, looking at the book of the story of the Kódeks.<br />
Then Ana moved a few pages, trying to find the fourth chapter and page one hundred thirteen.<br />
She found it and thanked Rose, then Rose walked back to her chair, sitting and continuing to read her book.<br />
Ana started reading chapter four, which reads:<br />
"At the beginning of the Kódek civilization, before the Big Curse of the Temacians, an evil race, the Kódeks have migrated to an island.<br />
They found a lot of crystals on that island, coming from the ground, some small ones, still growing.<br />
They were very beautiful, there were red, blue, cyan, pink, orange, yellow, white, black, and green crystals.<br />
The Kódeks did not know where those crystals came from.<br />
But after some Kódek Scientists and Researchers studied the crystals and the environment, they found out that a great entity planted those crystals there, with crystal seeds.<br />
They do not have crystal seeds there and do not know how to obtain them, but they still grew in there and spread.<br />
The Kódeks started building houses and huts on that island, making their home there, planting food and vegetables.<br />
Some Kódeks were in charge of breaking and cleaning the crystals, for them to not invade and take over the island, they could break houses if they grow close to the walls.<br />
One day, a Scientist got a pickax and mined one crystal, it was blue, he wanted to find out what the crystals were made from.<br />
The Kódek scientist grabbed that small blue crystal and studied it, he discovered that it had Potassium (K) in it.<br />
His name was Heckler, he started doing scientific research, giving the blue crystal to Kódeks and analyzing how their body changed, if they had more energy through the day.<br />
He discovered that eating the blue crystals, which had the element Potassium in them, helped Kódeks become stronger and grow faster, it helped them have energy through the day to do stuff.<br />
Heckler was a great Kódek Scientist, he discovered a lot of things.<br />
He continued mining and testing the other crystals, each one of them had a different element and helped the body differently.<br />
Every Kódek nowadays eats crystals just because of his discoveries, of how great those crystals were to the body.<br />
Other races do not have the habit of eating crystals, they really should try if they have the chance."<br />
"Wow, that is a lot to take in, that is so interesting! I have to tell mom and the other fairies about this, they're gonna be crazy!" Ana whispered.<br />
Rose heard her whisper and looked at her, saying, "Yeah, the story is awesome right?<br />
We Soul Wasps eat crystals every day, but we have some kind of medic prescription or some sort of balance.<br />
You don't wanna eat too much of them, bad things could happen".<br />
"Really? That's pretty cool Rose, I'm gonna tell the Fairies about this," said Ana.<br />
"Yeah, hehe, it is really good, I think the Fairies have crystals in the Crystal Lands right?" asked Rose.<br />
"Yes, we have, that will be easy for us, hehe.<br />
We have to cut them every day because they grow fast, they could take over the island," replied Ana, smiling at Rose.<br />
"Hey, can I read your book now please?" asked Rose.<br />
"Of course, I already read the interesting part, hehe," said Ana.<br />
Then Rose walked close to Ana with the book of the Soul Wasps and Fairies in her hand, they switched books.<br />
Ana started reading the book of the Soul Wasps and the Fairies, and Rose started reading the book about the story of the Kódeks.<br />
<br />
After some hours of reading, Ana was a little tired, she stretched and ate something, after that, she put the book back in its place on a bookshelf.<br />
Ana started walking out of the library and waved goodbye to Rose, the Soul Wasp, wanting to meet with her again soon, Ana thought that she was interesting.<br />
She walked to the center of the village and looked for Tod.<br />
Ana found him and started walking close to him, "Hey, Tod, I'm gonna go back home, I need to tell the Fairies about the importance of the crystals," said Ana.<br />
"Oh, okay, Ana, come with me, I'll show you where my hut is so you can say bye to my mother," said Tod.<br />
"Okay," said Ana smiling.<br />
They both started walking to the hut where Sophia, the mother of Tod, was sleeping.<br />
They arrived there and Sophia woke up.<br />
"Hey, Sophia, I'm gonna go back to the Crystal Lands to tell the Fairies about the importance of the crystals.<br />
So I thought it would be good for me to say bye to you first," said Ana.<br />
"Oh, okay my dear," said Sophia, getting up, then she turned into her human form and hugged Ana, smiling.<br />
Ana hugged her back, "Thank you, Ana, for bringing my son back home, you're always welcome here okay?" asked Sophia.<br />
"Thank you for your hospitality, Sophia, and thank you for receiving me here, you're so kind, hehe," said Ana, smiling, "It would be a pleasure to go back here for a visit".<br />
"No problem my dear, see you soon, Ana!" said Sophia, smiling.<br />
"See you soon, Sophia!" said Ana smiling.<br />
Then Ana hugged Tod tight in his human form and smiled at him, "Good luck on your survival things, see you soon, Ana," said Tod smiling.<br />
"Good luck for you too in your survival things Tod, see you soon!" said Ana, smiling.<br />
<br />
Then Ana started flying back to the Crystal Lands.<br />
She arrived there and all the Fairies greet her, smiling, saying they missed her and that she is an important part of the race of the Fairies.<br />
Lindsay gave Ana a big and tight hug, Panda too, they smiled at Ana.<br />
Ana started walking to the hut of her family with Panda and Lindsay.<br />
Jena, Lindsay, and Panda started eating dinner on the table.<br />
Ana smiled and sat with them to eat.<br />
"How was it to be in the Mountains of Aris, where the Kódeks lives, Ana?" asked Jena.<br />
"It was very good, mom, it was a pretty interesting place, I discovered the secrets of the crystals there, reading a book that they had in their library," said Ana while looking at Jena.<br />
"The secret is that the crystals were discovered first by the Kódeks, a Kódek Scientist called Heckler discovered that the crystals had elements in them.<br />
The elements that existed in the crystals gave great health benefits to the body, it helped it grow stronger and faster," said Ana.<br />
"That is pretty interesting my dear, I will tell some fairies to mine the crystals and collect them so we can get the benefit of those elements.<br />
We are gonna make some tests to see if that works, then, if the tests say that it works, we are going to start eating crystals too, along with food," said Jena smiling.<br />
After that, Ana finished eating and walked to her bedroom to sleep a little, she slept, listening to an owl, the water of the ocean hitting the shore.<br />
And the wind blowing on the trees of the island.<br />
After sleeping a little, Ana wakes up and goes to the kitchen, drinking some water.<br />
Then she starts flying to the beach, she sees Lindsay on the shore, looking at the ocean.<br />
Ana flies close to her and sits beside her.<br />
"Hey, Lindsay, what are you doing here?" asks Ana, curious.<br />
"I'm just thinking, sis, it's that I feel stuck on this island... I'm always here, just doing the stuff that normal fairies do.<br />
Just flying, collecting stuff, making magic and spells, playing ball..." said Lindsay, looking at the ground, a little sad.<br />
"Oh... I understand... I felt that too some months ago, that's why I left... That's why I always leave, it's because I feel stuck in here, and I don't think that I'm meant to be here...<br />
Of course, this is where I was born, and I should visit here, but I don't need to stay here... Do you understand?" asked Ana.<br />
"Yes..." replied Lindsay, who hugged Ana tight and closed her eyes.<br />
Ana embraced Lindsay and smiled a little, closing her eyes.<br />
"So... What should I do, sis?" asked Lindsay, opening her eyes.<br />
"Do you want to travel through islands with me when I go to them?<br />
This way you can think a little and reflect, think about what you want to do.<br />
And stay a little away from the opinions, thoughts, and expectations of others," asked Ana, breaking out from the hug and smiling at Lindsay.<br />
"Of course I want sis! It would be awesome, thanks...<br />
It would be good to take some time off to relax and think about life, reflect, hehe," replied Lindsay, hugging Ana again and smiling a lot.<br />
"Hehe, okay, sis, it will be very good to have your company, do you want me to teach you survival skills?" asked Ana.<br />
"Yes, I want to learn it with the best!" said Lindsay, smiling while looking at Ana.<br />
"Hehe, I'm not too good at surviving, sis, but thank you.<br />
Let's go to sleep?" asked Ana smiling.<br />
"Yes, little sis," replied Lindsay.<br />
They both started walking to the hut of their parents, Ana said goodnight to Lindsay, and Lindsay said goodnight back.<br />
They walked to their bedrooms, laid on the bed, and slept.

		"Hehe, okay, sis, it will be very good to have your company, do you want me to teach you survival skills?" asked Ana.<br />
"Yes, I want to learn it with the best!" said Lindsay, smiling while looking at Ana.<br />
"Hehe, I'm not too good at surviving, sis, but thank you.<br />
Let's go to sleep?" asked Ana smiling.<br />
"Okay, sis," said Lindsay.<br />
They both started walking to the hut of their parents, Ana said goodnight to Lindsay, and Lindsay said goodbye back.<br />
They walked to their bedrooms, laid on the bed, and slept.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Then, after waking up, Ana got up and walked to the kitchen, Jena had already made breakfast.<br />
Ana sat at the table, Lindsay and Panda were there too, Ana started to eat with them.<br />
"Hey, sis, do you want to take a bath at the ocean after we eat?" asked Lindsay, smiling.<br />
"Yes, a bath would be relaxing right now, even if I relaxed a lot while sleeping," replied Ana, smiling.<br />
Ana and her sisters finished eating, they started walking to the beach.<br />
Lindsay and Panda had necklaces too, they also gave them magic and spells.<br />
Lindsay had a necklace with a green jewel, it was given by her father, which was a fairy too.<br />
The necklace of Panda was purple, it was given by a friend of hers, that friend left the fairy colony some months ago to live alone, surviving on an island.<br />
Ana started walking to the ocean, she started swimming, Lindsay and Panda did the same thing.<br />
(A good bath in the ocean is always relaxing... Hmm... The chill water, closing your nose and submerging into the water, how relaxing...)<br />
Ana made a spell with the help of her necklace to throw some water in Lindsay and Panda, the trio smiled.<br />
Lindsay made a spell with her necklace that made it possible for the three to breathe underwater.<br />
The three started exploring the depths of the ocean, looking at the fishes and other marine creatures.<br />
It was so good to feel the chill water touch and cover their bodies, making them relax, making them feel the water and swim with it.<br />
They felt so happy and relaxed there, swimming while looking at the corals, the fishes, the sand, what a delightful feeling.<br />
Then the trio swam back to the surface, they noticed that they were a little far from the beach and the island.<br />
They submerged into the water again and started swimming back to the island.<br />
(This reminds me of a chapter of Desert Island where the character swam on the water, a little far, then came back to his island.)<br />
Ana got out of the water and started walking close to some fairy kids.<br />
"Hey, do you guys wanna breathe underwater?" asked Ana, Lindsay walked close to them, Panda did the same.<br />
"Yes!" replied the kids, smiling at Ana.<br />
Then Lindsay told them to get closer together, Lindsay made the spell using her necklace and the kids could now breathe underwater.<br />
They thanked Ana and Lindsay, smiling, then walked close to the water and begin to swim, smiling and breathing underwater.<br />
"Hey girls, I think I'm gonna take a bath and then I'm gonna go to an island," said Ana, looking at her sisters.<br />
"Okay, can I come with you, Ana?" asked Lindsay, looking at Ana's eyes.<br />
"Of course sis! Hehe," replied Ana, smiling, "Do you wanna come too?" asked her, looking at Panda.<br />
"No, thanks sis, I think I'm gonna stay here taking care of mom and the village, also, mom said that the experiment of the crystals will begin today in the afternoon," explained Panda.<br />
"Oh, okay, tell me how it was after it is finished okay?" asked Ana.<br />
"Okay sis, good luck on that island, hehe," said Panda, smiling at Ana and Lindsay.<br />
"Thanks, little sis!" said Ana smiling.<br />
<br />
Then Ana flew to her hut, where her parents lived, she walked to the bathroom and took a bath.<br />
Then she walked close to Lindsay, which was in the living room.<br />
"Hey sis, do you wanna go now?" asked Ana.<br />
"Yes, I just gotta take a quick bath okay?" asked Lindsay.<br />
"Okay, I'll wait for you, hehe," said Ana.<br />
Lindsay then took a bath, she walked to the kitchen and ate something, then she walked to the living room where Ana was.<br />
They both told Panda that they were leaving, they hugged Panda and she hugged them back.<br />
The two walked to where their mother was and told her that they were going to an island, it was still morning.<br />
Jena hugged them and the two hugged her back, smiling, Jena was going to miss their daughters.<br />
Then Ana and Lindsay started flying, they flew high and hold her necklaces.<br />
Ana started looking for a good island where she had not gone before, Lindsay was following her.<br />
She stayed at a lot of islands, surviving, so she left her stuff there, the axes, baskets, food, and other tools.<br />
Ana found a good island and flew close to it, she landed on the sand, Lindsay did that too.<br />
"Is this the island that we're gonna stay, sis?" asked Lindsay, looking at Ana.<br />
"Yes, do you like it?" asked Ana, smiling.<br />
"Yes, it is pretty beautiful and big, hehe," replied Lindsay smiling, she was happy to survive along with her sister.<br />
So Ana started looking for a sharp stone that looked like a knife, she told Lindsay to do the same.<br />
Lindsay found one and gave it to Ana, she smiled.<br />
Ana walked close to some stones and grabbed a large one, she walked to the ocean and soaked it in water.<br />
"This is needed for you to sharpen the stone, so you can cut stuff with it," said Ana.<br />
"So you sharpen the stone with another stone but it is wet?" asked Lindsay, curious.<br />
"Yes," replied Ana.<br />
Then Ana grabbed the stone and left it close to the edge between the forest and the beach.<br />
Ana told Lindsay to get closer, Lindsay walked close and sat beside her.<br />
Ana started sharpening the stone by scraping it on the larger stone.<br />
She gave the stone for Lindsay to try, Lindsay managed to sharpen the stone, it was very good, Ana was proud.<br />
Then Ana walked to a tree and grabbed a thick stick, she showed Lindsay how to cut the tree when you do not have an ax.<br />
Lindsay grabbed both of them and cut the tree very easily.<br />
"I'm gonna show you how you make an ax, sis," said Ana.<br />
"Okay, I'm so excited, hehe," said Lindsay smiling.<br />
Then Ana cut the tree in half and told Lindsay to make a hole in the half tree to put a sharp stone in there.<br />
Lindsay did the hole and smiled at Ana, Ana was proud.<br />
Ana walked to the forest and looked for a rectangular stone, she found one and brought it close to where Lindsay was sitting.<br />
"Now you need to sharpen this rectangular stone to serve as the blade for the ax, then you put the stone inside the hole," said Ana.<br />
Lindsay grabbed the rectangular stone and sharpened it using the big wet stone.<br />
Then she grabbed the thick tree branch with a hole and inserted the rectangular stone inside it.<br />
Lindsay grabbed another thick tree branch and started hitting the rectangular stone with it to attach the stone tight to the ax handle.<br />
She finished making the ax, Lindsay smiled at Ana, "Thanks, sis, I'm so proud of this ax, hehe," said Lindsay, smiling.<br />
"No problem, sis, hehe, I loved to teach you, you're very good," said Ana, smiling.<br />
<br />
Then Ana got up and started walking to the forest, she arrived there and started gathering dry leaves and tree branches.<br />
She left those dry leaves and tree branches in a place close to the big wet stone.<br />
"Now we gonna start to make a fire okay?" asked Ana.<br />
"Okay, sis," said Lindsay, smiling, willing to learn.<br />
"So, arrange these dry leaves and tree branches like a campfire," said Ana.<br />
Lindsay did that, after that, she waited for her sister's instructions.<br />
"Now get two sticks, and make three holes in one," said Ana.<br />
Lindsay got up and looked for two sticks in the forest, she grabbed them and walked back to Ana, grabbing the stone knife and making three holes in one.<br />
"Put the stick with the holes on top of the dry leaves," said Ana.<br />
Lindsay placed the stick with holes on top of the dry leaves.<br />
Then Ana said for her to get another stick and put it on one hole of the stick with holes, she did that and started rotating the stick with no holes.<br />
Smoke started to come out of the dry leaves after Lindsay started rotating the stick.<br />
Lindsay grabbed the dry leaves and started blowing them.<br />
Ana said for her to put the dry leaves on top of the sticks and tree branches after the fire starts.<br />
Lindsay did that and the fire started, she kept adding sticks and tree branches to fuel it.<br />
Ana clapped and smiled at Lindsay, "Congrats sis! You just did fire!" said Ana.<br />
"Hehe, thanks sis, I could do this with your help, you helped me a lot, thanks," said Lindsay smiling.<br />
"Hehe, are you hungry? I think it is almost afternoon," asked Ana.<br />
"Yes, I'm a little hungry, what are we gonna eat?" asked Lindsay.<br />
"First we need something to catch the food," said Ana.<br />
"Hmm... A spear?" asked Lindsay.<br />
"Exactly, we need to find a good thin tree to cut it down and use it as the spear," said Ana.<br />
Then they started walking to the forest, looking for that type of tree, Lindsay was holding the ax.<br />
Ana found a thin tree and told Lindsay to use the ax to cut it.<br />
Lindsay cut it down and grabbed the thin log, they started walking back to the campfire.<br />
They sat on the ground and Ana told Lindsay to put the tip of the spear into the fire to char the blunt tip, she did that.<br />
Then Lindsay scraped the burning tip of the spear in a large stone to sharpen it.<br />
After that, Lindsay grabbed a piece of wood and polished the tip of the spear with it.<br />
"Good work, sis!" said Ana smiling.<br />
"Thanks, sis! Can we fish something?" asked Lindsay.<br />
"Yes, I'm gonna teach you how to use the spear to catch fish," said Ana, walking to the shore of the beach, close to the water.<br />
Lindsay walked there too, holding the spear.<br />
Ana taught Lindsay how to aim the spear at the water, she said for her to wait for the water to get calm and the fish to calm down.<br />
After that, Lindsay looked at the water, looking for some fish, she waited for a little and shot the spear, aiming at a fish.<br />
She got one fish on the first try, Ana was smiling, proud of her sister.<br />
"Hehe, you're like a prodigy sis, you're so good at this!" said Ana smiling.<br />
"Thanks, sis, I learned with the best, hehe," said Lindsay, smiling at Ana.<br />
<br />
Then Ana grabbed the fish from the spear Lindsay and left it on top of a stone.<br />
"Now let's skin the fish to remove its scales so we can eat it," said Ana.<br />
Then Lindsay grabbed the knife stone and grabbed the fish, removing the scales of it.<br />
After that, Ana helped Lindsay to search for tree branches shaped like a Y.<br />
They found them and cut them down, after that, they placed those branches inside the ground, close to the campfire.<br />
Then they found another good branch and walked back to the campfire, Lindsay grabbed the fish and put it on the tree branch.<br />
Lindsay placed more branches on the fire and placed the tree branch with the fish on top of the two branches shaped like a Y.<br />
They were making a spit of a fish, the fish started to cook very nicely.<br />
Lindsay hugged Ana tight and smiled at her, happy for doing the ax, the campfire, and cooking the fish.<br />
"Thanks for helping me and teaching me about a lot of things of survival sis, hehe," said Lindsay, smiling.<br />
"I'm always happy to teach you things, sis, it is good to teach the others what we know," said Ana, smiling.<br />
They waited for the fish to cook, Lindsay walked close to it to check it and it was good.<br />
Lindsay removed the fish from the stick, Ana grabbed the spear and caught a fish for her, then she skinned it.<br />
Ana placed the raw fish in the stick and placed it on top of the two sticks for it to cook.<br />
She waited for the fish to get ready and placed the cooked fish on top of a stone, cutting it in half and removing thorns and bones, Lindsay did that too.<br />
They both started eating their fish, smiling at each other, the fish was delicious.<br />
"What can we do right now, sis?" asked Lindsay, looking at Ana.<br />
"Are you tired?" asked Ana.<br />
"Just a little, what about you?" asked Lindsay.<br />
"Just a little too, do you want to sleep?" asked Ana.<br />
"Yes," replied Lindsay.<br />
Then they both lied on the sand close to the fire and started to sleep, relaxing and resting.

		She waited for the fish to get ready and placed the cooked fish on top of a stone, cutting it in half and removing thorns and bones, Lindsay did that too.<br />
They both started eating their fish, smiling at each other, the fish was delicious.<br />
"What can we do right now, sis?" asked Lindsay, looking at Ana.<br />
"Are you tired?" asked Ana.<br />
"Just a little, what about you?" asked Lindsay.<br />
"Just a little too, do you want to sleep?" asked Ana.<br />
"Yes," replied Lindsay.<br />
Then they both lied on the sand close to the fire and started to sleep, relaxing and resting.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
After that, they woke up, Ana walked to the forest to search for some mud.<br />
She found and grabbed it with her hands, she walked close to the ashes of the fire and left the mud there.<br />
Ana started the fire again and refueled it, she made two jars of mud and left them close to the fire to dry.<br />
Then Ana walked to the ocean and filled one jar with water.<br />
Ana and Lindsay made some bricks with mud and made a furnace around the campfire.<br />
After that, Ana made a lid of mud, she placed the lid on top of the furnace for it to dry.<br />
Then Lindsay placed the jar with water on top of the furnace and placed the lid on it, the water started to boil.<br />
After waiting for some minutes, Ana picked up two pieces of wood and grabbed the hot jar with them.<br />
She waited for the water to chill, while waiting, she made two cups of mud and placed them close to the fire, waiting for them to dry.<br />
The water was chill now, Ana and Lindsay drank one cup of water, they were happy about the things they built.<br />
Ana and Lindsay looked at the sun, the waves of the ocean, the birds, they listened to nature, it was so good.<br />
They were relaxed and calm, listening to the sounds of nature, feeling the chill breeze, lying on the sand.<br />
The two looked at the birds, they could fly just like them, they were happy to be able to fly.<br />
Because they felt free and relaxed, it was good to look at the islands and see them from far away, see every part of them.<br />
They just enjoyed that moment, not thinking about their family, their problems, the future, or the past.<br />
Just relaxing and enjoying the current moment, the present, the infinite moment, it is full of good things to do.<br />
Ana and Lindsay closed their eyes, they imagined a world inside a crystal, where people could live.<br />
Then they imagined an empty world, an empty void with nothing, just an infinite white floor, and no walls.<br />
You could walk forever in there and you would not find an end or a wall.<br />
They thought about that place, about that void, they thought that it would be really good to be there.<br />
To just think about nothing and relax, relax your mind, not thinking about anything, not thinking about problems, the past or the future, just feeling, listening.<br />
They thought that it would be good for them to meditate a little, to feel the world a little, feel nature.<br />
Because that is something that is been here since forever, and all the other things were things that men created.<br />
So they enjoyed nature at that moment, just feeling the sand, the sun, feeling the wind, listening to the ocean, the birds, the trees shaking.<br />
They thought that void was like lying on the sand, it was relaxing, empty, simple, not too many things to think about.<br />
Ana always felt that when she survived and built nature things on desert islands, that relaxation, and calm.<br />
Lindsay felt that for the first time, that connection with mother nature and the Earth, was so good for her, it was a new feeling.<br />
Lindsay was very happy, smiling from ear to ear with her eyes closed.<br />
Ana was happy too, she could show Lindsay how nature was awesome and relaxing.<br />
<br />
Then Ana got up, she looked at Lindsay, "Hey sis, do you wanna take a bath on the ocean?" asked Ana.<br />
"Yes, it looks as relaxing as being laid on the sand, feeling nature and listening to it," replied Lindsay, smiling.<br />
"Hehe, okay," said Ana, who started walking close to the ocean, Lindsay followed her.<br />
They started walking deeper into the water, it was going from their toes to their tummy, then to their neck, they started swimming and holding their breath.<br />
Ana and Lindsay started swimming together, submerging into the ocean and feeling the chill water around them, they were happy, smiling.<br />
Ana held her necklace and made a spell for both of them to be able to breathe underwater, it was so relaxing.<br />
They submerged deeper and deeper inside the ocean, looking at the fishes and the corals, exploring the ocean, the unknown.<br />
Lindsay made a spell using her necklace, now they both could shoot waves of water from their feet, just like motorboats does.<br />
They swam quickly in the water, going back and forth, the fishes looked at them with curiosity.<br />
The two swam back to the surface and smiled at each other, the water going off their heads, they stayed on the surface, hovering.<br />
"It is so good to swim with you little sis, hehe," said Lindsay, smiling.<br />
"Hehe, I'm glad you like it, sis," replied Ana.<br />
"The fairies probably already began collecting the elements from the crystals by now," said Lindsay.<br />
"Oh, that's good, do you want to go there to check it?" asked Ana.<br />
"No, I want to stay here with you sis, hehe," replied Lindsay smiling.<br />
"Okay," said Ana, smiling too.<br />
<br />
They looked at the island and its trees, palm trees, the sand.<br />
The two began to swim back to the island, feeling the water run through their bodies.<br />
Ana and Lindsay got off the water and started walking on the sand, the fire was a little low but was still active.<br />
Ana grabbed the ax and cut four trees, she thought about making a house, she and Lindsay grabbed the four logs and brought them close to the fire.<br />
Then Ana walked to a good place in the forest, she started arranging the terrain to make a hut there, making the terrain flatter.<br />
Lindsay helped her, she finished cleaning the terrain and walked close to the campfire, she sat on the ground and cut two logs in half.<br />
Leaving her with four half logs or smaller logs, she brought them close to the cleaned terrain and dug four holes on the ground in a square shape.<br />
Ana gave the four logs to Lindsay and she placed all of them inside the holes that Ana made.<br />
Then Ana grabbed a thick stick and dug a hole in the middle of two logs that were inside the ground.<br />
She walked close to the campfire and grabbed one log that was not cut in half.<br />
After that, she walked to the place where they were building the hut, Ana inserted the tall log inside the hole that she made in the middle of the two smaller logs.<br />
It was going to be the support for the roof of grass that Ana was thinking of making.<br />
Then Lindsay dug a hole on the opposite side of the tall log that Ana placed inside the ground.<br />
She walked close to the campfire and grabbed the other log that was not cut in half, then she walked back to where Ana was.<br />
Lindsay inserted the tall log inside the hole she had made in the middle of the other two smaller logs.<br />
Ana walked deeper into the forest and grabbed some vines to use as mooring.<br />
Then she left the vines on the floor, inside the square made of logs.<br />
Ana grabbed the ax and cut three more trees, she brought them to the square where they were making the hut.<br />
Then Ana grabbed one log and the vines, she placed one side of the log on the top of the tall log, she tied the logs together.<br />
After that, Ana lifted the other side of the horizontal log to tie it with the other tall log.<br />
Lindsay held the log for her and Ana tied up the two logs together.<br />
Then Ana grabbed one more log that she had cut and placed it close to the two small logs on the left side of the hut.<br />
She tied the two sides of the horizontal log with the two small logs with the help of Lindsay.<br />
Ana did the same with the right side of the hut, tying them up together.<br />
"Hey sis, can you bring me six logs please?" asked Ana.<br />
"Of course, hehe," said Lindsay, who grabbed the ax and walked deeper into the forest, cutting six trees.<br />
<br />
She returned with the six logs, bringing two at a time.<br />
Ana made three rafters with those six logs, each of them was two logs tied together to make a frame for the roof of the hut.<br />
Lindsay and Ana placed the three rafters on top of the hut, making the frame of the roof.<br />
One on the front of the hut, one on the middle, and one on the back of the hut.<br />
Ana tied the three rafters together with the three horizontal logs with the help of the vines.<br />
Then Ana cut two more trees and cut them in half, she made two holes in the middle of the two sides of the hut, the front and the back of the hut, in the middle of the two logs on each side.<br />
She placed two logs inside the holes, one on each hole, one log on the left side of the hut, and one on the right side.<br />
Then Lindsay grabbed the ax and cut ten trees, they had thin logs, Lindsay brought all of them to where Ana was.<br />
Ana started adding logs to the frame of the roof where the grass would be.<br />
She used five logs on the left side and five on the right side.<br />
Then Ana cut one tree, cut it in half, and brought it to the hut.<br />
After that, she made two holes on the ground, all on the back of the hut.<br />
One between the support of the roof and the small log on the left, and another between the support of the roof and the small log on the right side, making the back of the hut.<br />
Ana and Lindsay grabbed a stone blade each, it was a sharp stone that could be used to cut things.<br />
They walked around the forest looking for grass to cut, to use as the roof of the hut.<br />
Ana and Lindsay managed to get some packs of grass to use as the roof.<br />
The two walked to the place where the hut was being built.<br />
Lindsay placed the grass and Ana tied it to the roof using the vines.<br />
After some minutes of placing the grass and tying it up to the roof, they finished making the roof of the hut.<br />
Ana grabbed a stick and grabbed some grass with it, lifting it and placing it on top of the roof to fill the gaps where rain would go inside the hut.<br />
<br />
Then Lindsay grabbed the ax and cut some trees to make the wall of the hut.<br />
She brought the logs to the place where the hut was being built.<br />
Ana used the logs that Lindsay brought to weave in and out of the logs of the hut, making the wall and leaving the front of the hut with no wall, for entrance.<br />
Ana and Lindsay walked to a river that existed in the forest, they grabbed some mud and walked back to the hut.<br />
They started plastering the walls with the mud, covering the logs with it.<br />
After that, they plastered all the walls, Ana and Lindsay also used the mud to plaster the floor, making it flat, clean, and good to lie in.<br />
The mud stays on provided the roof keeps the rain off.<br />
Then Ana and Lindsay made a fire inside the hut to dry out the grass and the mud walls.<br />
After that, Ana filled one jar of mud with water and walked to the furnace, she placed the jar on top of the furnace with the lid on.<br />
Then she walked to the forest to grab some sticks and branches to use as fuel for the campfire that was like a furnace.<br />
The water in the jar started boiling, after waiting for a little, Ana grabbed the jar with two thick branches and waited for it to cool down.<br />
Ana then grabbed the jar and two cups of mud, she walked to the hut and sat on the floor, filling two cups of water, one for her and one for Lindsay.<br />
They drank the water, looking at the ocean, the front of the hut was facing the ocean, they looked at the water moving and the waves forming.<br />
There was a cool breeze in there, it was good to spend some time on that island.<br />
Ana got up and walked to a banana tree, she picked up two bananas, one for her and one for Lindsay.<br />
Then she walked back to the hut and gave one banana to Lindsay.<br />
Both of them ate while smiling at each other, feeling nature.<br />
"It is so good to survive with you sis, hehe, I'm so happy," said Lindsay smiling.<br />
"I think the same, sis, thanks for spending some time with me, I'm so lonely sometimes, surviving alone, it is good to have some company," said Ana, smiling.<br />
"Hehe, I'm glad to be your company, sis," said Lindsay, who then hugged Ana tight, smiling.<br />
Ana returned the hug and smiled, they lied on the floor of the hut, they were a little tired, it was almost night.<br />
It started raining a little, a calm and relaxing rain, it watered the roof of the hut, it shook all the trees.<br />
The rain probably put out the fire that was close to the shore of the island.<br />
They slept while listening to the calm rain, making the island colder, but still good to sleep in, the fire inside the hut could warm them if they needed it.

		In the morning, Lindsay woke up and Ana did not, Lindsay grabbed the two cups and the jar.<br />
She walked close to the furnace and ignited the fire, then she boiled some water for both of them to drink.<br />
Lindsay walked back to the hut and left the jar of water close to Ana, Lindsay drank one cup of water and looked at Ana, she caressed her hair.<br />
Then Lindsay grabbed one banana and ate it, after that, she grabbed two bananas and left them at the side of the jar of water, for Ana to drink and eat when she wakes up.<br />
After that, Lindsay grabbed the spear and walked close to the ocean, trying to catch a fish.<br />
She got two and placed both of them on the sticks above the furnace to cook them.<br />
Lindsay skinned the fishes, then cooked them, she cut them in half and removed the thorns, bones, and other things that were not eatable.<br />
Then Lindsay grabbed a medium stone, brought the stone to the hut, then placed one cooked fish on top of it for Ana to eat.<br />
Lindsay ate her fish and drank one cup of water, smiling, the fish tasted delicious.<br />
After that, Lindsay left the ax, spear, sharp stone blade, and fire sticks out of the hut.<br />
She started flying, she flew high in the sky and started looking to the islands that were far away.<br />
Lindsay asked herself where the Crystal Lands were, she held her necklace and felt where home was, she looked to the right.<br />
After that, she landed on the sand, looking at the hut, spear, ax, campfire, and furnace.<br />
Ana woke up, drank the water, ate the two bananas and the fish, then she walked out of the hut, looking for Lindsay.<br />
"Hey sis, thanks for making breakfast for me, hehe," said Ana smiling.<br />
"No problem, hehe, I like to take care of you, you're my younger sister after all," said Lindsay, smiling.<br />
"Hehe, hey sis, do you want to go back home to check the status of the crystal experiment with me?<br />
We can go back to this island later if you want," asked Ana.<br />
"Yes, I want, can you do a spell for us to be able to locate this island when we want to go back?" asked Lindsay.<br />
"Yeah, I'll do it," replied Ana, who held her necklace and made a sphere with yellow borders that looked like neon.<br />
"How should we name this island?" asked Ana.<br />
"We should name it 'The Hut, Spear and Ax Island'," replied Lindsay.<br />
"That's a good name," said Ana, who named that island "The Hut, Spear, and Ax Island", that name appeared on top of the yellow sphere.<br />
They could hold their necklaces and they would feel where that island was located, just like a GPS or compass.<br />
After that, Ana and Lindsay took flight, they held their necklaces to feel where home was, then they started flying there.<br />
<br />
Then, after some time flying, both of them arrived there, they landed on the sand, there were some fairies there.<br />
"Do you know where my mom is?" asked Ana, looking at one of the fairies.<br />
"Yes, she is in her hut," replied one fairy.<br />
Then Ana and Lindsay flew to their hut, they found Jena sitting on a chair at the kitchen table.<br />
"Hey mom, we're back," said Ana to Jena.<br />
"Hey my dear, you're here," said Jena, who got up to hug Lindsay and Ana.<br />
"So, how is the experiment going?" asked Ana.<br />
"Well, we did a lot of tests, some fairies were becoming stronger after each day, and they had a lot of energy to do things through the day.<br />
I told them to start eating crystals every day because they were good for their health.<br />
I put a fairy in charge of being a nutritionist.<br />
To analyze the body and the health of the fairies to tell them what crystals they should eat and in what quantity," explained Jena.<br />
"Oh, that's very good to hear mom!" said Ana, smiling.<br />
"Hehe, yes, it is a very good thing, you made a very important discovery daughter! I'm so proud of you," said Jena, hugging Ana, and looking at her eyes.<br />
"Thanks, mom, I'm happy that you're proud of me," said Ana, smiling.<br />
"Do you both wanna eat something?" asked Jena.<br />
"Yes, what there's for lunch?" asked Lindsay.<br />
"We have a fish barbecue with lots of vegetables and some spices," said Jena, smiling at her daughters.<br />
"That sounds delicious mom!" said Ana, smiling.<br />
After that, Ana, Lindsay, and Jena sat at the table to eat, the fish barbecue was served.<br />
"Hey, Lindsay, go call Panda, please.<br />
She is playing some ball at the beach," said Jena.<br />
"Okay mom," said Lindsay.<br />
Then she got out of the house to call Panda for lunch, after some seconds, Panda and Lindsay arrived at their mother's hut.<br />
The whole family ate the barbecued fish with vegetables, it was very delicious, Ana ate a little more than everyone, it has been some time since she ate something so delicious.<br />
<br />
After that, Lindsay and Ana walked outside to feel the wind, it was very good, they wanted to relax a little and wait for the food to digest.<br />
Panda walked to the ocean to take a bath in it, it was good to take a bath in the cool ocean on such a hot afternoon.<br />
Ana and Lindsay just sat on the sand, below the leaves of the trees, on the shadow of them, they felt the cool wind.<br />
They looked at the beach and saw some fairies eating blue crystals, they thought about making an appointment with the fairy nutritionist to know what crystals they should eat.<br />
Both of them got up and started flying back to the village, Ana and Lindsay flew to their hut.<br />
They both grabbed a backpack, they placed notepads, books, pencils, pens, and other writing stuff inside the backpacks.<br />
After that, they flew to the town hall, they found Jena there.<br />
"Hey mom, we're gonna go back to that island to do a little more stuff okay?" asked Ana.<br />
"Okay, take care of your sister, Ana, and take care of her too, Lindsay," said Jena, who hugged Ana and Lindsay.<br />
"Okay mom, I'll take care of her, and she'll take care of me, hehe," said Ana, smiling.<br />
"Hehe, yes mom," said Lindsay.<br />
After that, both of them started flying to that island again, holding their necklaces to know where it was, they were wearing the backpacks.<br />
They arrived there, Ana searched for the hut and found it, she grabbed the ax and cut a tree.<br />
Then Ana cut the log in half and made a hole in it, to put a sharp stone inside it.<br />
"Hey, sis, can you bring a rectangular stone for me?" asked Ana.<br />
"Of course, hehe, just give me a minute," replied Lindsay.<br />
Lindsay started looking for a good rectangular stone to give to Ana so she could make another ax.<br />
She found one and brought it to Ana, Ana grabbed it, then she grabbed a large stone, walked to the ocean, and soaked it in water.<br />
After that, Ana started sharpening the stone to make an ax blade.<br />
Ana was sitting on the ground, sharpening the stone, Lindsay was standing, looking at Ana, she saw a blue light at her side.<br />
Suddenly, a strange creature appeared there on the island, it was beside Lindsay, it looked like it came from the sky, from out of the planet.<br />
Its face was a screen, it had a blue dot on its screen, it said that the name of their species was Korvax, they did not have a defined gender.<br />
"There are some aliens that are invading my planet, I think they are of the Gek species.<br />
So I fled here, to this planet, they have a lot of spaceships, landing on my planet even right now...<br />
It was very scary," said the alien, in shock, scared.<br />
"Oh, I understand, how did you flee here?" asked Ana.<br />
"I used my spaceship to get out of my planet.<br />
Then I sent a teleport beam to here, to teleport to the ground, to here where I am right now.<br />
My name is Tetracovix," said the alien.<br />
"Oh, my name is Ana, nice to meet you," said Ana, raising her hand for Tetracovix to hold.<br />
Tetracovix held her hand and shook it, Lindsay said her name and shook its hand too.<br />
"I'm sorry for your planet and your people, Tetracovix," said Ana, sad, looking at the screen of Tetracovix, where she thought its eyes would be.<br />
"Thanks, Ana and Lindsay, I would like some help to go back there and defeat the aliens, the invaders, which are called Geks.<br />
Would you two like to help me?" asked Tetracovix, the Korvax, looking at Ana and Lindsay.<br />
"Uh..." said Ana, looking at Lindsay, "Maybe... Is it too dangerous?" asked Ana, uncertain.<br />
"No, if your spaceship gets destroyed you'll be teleported back to here, I installed that type of system on the spaceship," replied Tetracovix.<br />
"Oh, okay, where is this spaceship?" asked Lindsay.<br />
"It is close to the atmosphere of this planet, high up there," said him, pointing to the sky.<br />
"And why don't you go there to get it?" asked Ana.<br />
"Because my teleport gun can't point to there, because I don't know where the spaceship is exactly.<br />
If I point my teleport gun up it could hit anything physical like an asteroid.<br />
You have wings don't you?" asked Tetracovix.<br />
"Yes, why?" asked Lindsay.<br />
"Because you could fly up there to get the spaceship back.<br />
I'll give you an Exo suit so you can take the pressure of the atmosphere and breathe without air up there," replied Tetracovix.<br />
"Okay... What do you think sister?" asked Ana, looking at Lindsay.<br />
"I guess that's safe... Does this suit have a hole for our wings to go out? We can't fly without them," asked Lindsay.<br />
"Yes, it adapts to your body, so if you have a tail or wings it would make a hole for them," replied Tetracovix.<br />
"Okay... Can you give us that suit right now?" asked Ana.<br />
"Of course," replied him, who grabbed a kind of electronic device that had a screen, Lindsay and Ana had never seen that type of thing before.<br />
He touched two buttons on the touch screen and dragged two suit images in the direction of Lindsay and Ana with its fingers.<br />
After that, Ana and Lindsay now had one Exo suit each, it had a jetpack or jump pack, a survival system, and some armor protection, it also had a hole for their wings.<br />
The items that were inside their backpacks were teleported to the inventory of the Exo suit, the inventory had notepads, books, pencils, and pens.<br />
"Thanks, Tetracovix, we're gonna help you," said Ana, looking at him.<br />
"Yes, we're gonna save your planet," said Lindsay, looking at the suit, then looking at Tetracovix.<br />
"But first, can you tell us about everything about this suit and the spaceship?" asked Ana.<br />
"Yes, of course, I'll also give you two a Multi-tool in case you need to collect some resources there.<br />
And also engage in combat without your spaceship," replied Tetracovix.<br />
"Really? Resources? There are crystals there too?" asked Ana, curious.<br />
"Yes, but there are only red crystals that give plutonium, they can be used to recharge the spaceship's devices, your multi-tool, and the protective layers of your Exo suit," replied Tetracovix.<br />
"Oh, that's cool, hehe," said Ana, smiling.<br />
After that, Tetracovix explained everything about the Exo suit, spaceship, and multi-tool for them.<br />
<br />
Ana and Lindsay started flying up using the Exo suit, they had their multi-tools in hand.<br />
Tetracovix stayed on the island, it knew how to do survival stuff too, it looked at the hut that Ana and Lindsay had made, it looked very good.<br />
He grabbed the spear, caught a fish, and skinned it, then it cooked it using the furnace that Ana and Lindsay had made.<br />
After some minutes of flying, Ana and Lindsay arrived at the spaceship.<br />
It was hovering in the atmosphere, wasting its fuel to stay close to the planet but not be dragged by its gravity.<br />
Ana opened the door of the spaceship and sat at the seat of it, Lindsay sat at the back of Ana.<br />
She pushed some type of accelerator that the spaceship had, moving the steering wheel to move the spaceship.<br />
After that, Ana got far from her planet, she looked at it from far away, she could see all the islands, she saw the Crystal Lands where she lived.<br />
The Mountains of Aris where the Kódeks lived, where Tod lived, and the Clouds of Madness.<br />
Ana oppositely turned the spaceship, she saw the red planet that Tetracovix said it lived on, the spaceship had some type of interplanetary scanner.<br />
She pushed a button and the spaceship scanned the planet where Tetracovix lived, it was called "Gears of the Korvax".<br />
Then Ana turned the spaceship to her planet, she scanned it, it was called "Earth (Crystal Version)".<br />
She could see the galaxy and universe where that planet was, the galaxy was called the "Milky Way", the universe was called "C-512 (Crystal Empire)".<br />
Ana found it weird that the universe had "Crystal Empire" written on it, she thought about it for a while, "Why there is an empire about the crystals? They are something that special?" said her.<br />
"What is the Crystal Empire, sis?" asked Lindsay, looking at the screen.<br />
"I don't know, maybe it is something that governs the galaxy with crystals and stuff.<br />
And that they have the monopoly of the crystals, or maybe I'm thinking too much, hehe," replied Ana.<br />
Ana and Lindsay were surprised by that, the planet of Tetracovix, all the things it told to them, the discovery of the name of their planet, Earth (Crystal Version), the Crystal Empire.<br />
They found that very weird, and it was weird to look at all the planets that existed in the galaxy that they were.<br />
Ana and Lindsay thought that only their planet existed, not other planets.<br />
The spaceship did not have enough fuel to use the speed boost device.<br />
Ana thought that the planet that was at war, the planet of Tetracovix, was too dangerous to go right now, they could see explosions of spaceships there.<br />
The spaceship was facing the planet of Tetracovix, the planet of Ana and Lindsay was behind the spaceship.<br />
Ana noticed that the spaceship only had space for two people, so Tetracovix could not go with them on it.<br />
After looking at the planet, Ana turned the spaceship a little to the right and pushed the accelerator, flying to a planet that looked safe to land on.<br />
"Hey sister, what do you think about the planet called Gears of the Korvax?" asked Lindsay, looking at the planet that Ana was going to.<br />
"I think it is dangerous to go there right now.<br />
But it probably was a good place to live in before that race invaded them and started a war," replied Ana.<br />
"Yeah... I agree," said Lindsay, a little sad.<br />
"But we gonna make it okay? Don't worry, it looks like they are stopping, the explosions are becoming rarer.<br />
I just gotta stop at this planet to get some Uranium to refuel the spaceship's devices, Tetracovix said that it would be out of fuel," said Ana.<br />
"Okay sis, can I drive when we go out of the planet?" asked Lindsay.<br />
"Yes, you can sis," said Ana, pushing the accelerator of the spaceship.

		After some time flying, they arrived at the planet, Ana landed on the ground, they both got off the spaceship.<br />
Ana scanned the planet, she could see a lot of resource icons with her visor.<br />
Then Ana and Lindsay started walking on the planet with their multi-tools, using their Exo suits.<br />
They heard a voice telling something in their minds, "Thermal Protection in fall", they could see that the planet was a little hot, it was 55 Celsius, 131 Fahrenheit, 328 Kelvin.<br />
Ana and Lindsay both opened the inventory of their Exo suits.<br />
They both walked to a yellow flower and collected the elements of it using their multi-tools.<br />
Both of them received the element Sodium, they used it to recharge the Hazard Protection device in the Exo suit, it protected them from extreme heat, cold, toxicity, or radiation, it was almost full.<br />
Then Ana started looking around the planet, looking for Uranium, the planet had some iron and iridium resource deposits.<br />
Ana found a good Uranium resource deposit, she saw that it was far away, they needed the spaceship to go there.<br />
"Hey sis, do you wanna drive now?<br />
I found a good Uranium resource far away from here, we need to go there by spaceship," asked Ana.<br />
"Of course I want! Thanks for asking sis," replied Lindsay, smiling.<br />
They both walked back to the spaceship and entered inside it, Lindsay turned the spaceship on and took flight.<br />
She marked the Uranium resource deposit in the map of the spaceship, then she pushed the accelerator of the spaceship and started flying there.<br />
Ana placed her hands on the right window of the spaceship, looking at the ground from above, curious about the fauna and flora of the planet, the animals, and the plants.<br />
She wondered if she could eat the plants or if they were poisonous.<br />
Lindsay just looked at the waypoint on the front window of the spaceship, pushing the accelerator of it, she was liking the adventure.<br />
They arrived at the Uranium resource deposit, Lindsay pushed a button on the spaceship, it landed.<br />
Ana and Lindsay got out of the spaceship, walked close to the resource deposit, they grabbed their multi-tools.<br />
Both of them started mining the resource deposit with the Terrain Manipulation device that the multi-tool had.<br />
They gathered a lot of Uranium, then they used that Uranium to refuel the Launch Thruster device of the spaceship which was used to take flight.<br />
The two also mined a nearby Pyrite resource deposit, they used that Pyrite to recharge the Pulse Engine of the spaceship, which allowed them to fly, do a Pulse Jump, which is flying very fast, and gain speed boosts.<br />
They noticed a creature close to the resource deposit, the creature was of the Korvax species too, just like Tetracovix.<br />
"Hey Korvax!" said Ana, waving at him.<br />
"Hey," said the Korvax, walking close to Ana and Lindsay.<br />
"What are you two doing in here?" asked the Korvax.<br />
"We're just collecting some elements to use as fuel for our spaceship," replied Lindsay.<br />
"Oh, this planet is called Rochesk Alpha, it is very hot, you will need a good thermal protection device to stay in here, it needs to be upgraded too," explained him.<br />
"Oh, we know, we already have a good protection device, can I ask your name?" asked Ana.<br />
"Sure, my name is Zyoox, I am a Korvax," replied the Korvax.<br />
"Oh... Your planet is being invaded by the Gek race, Zyoox," said Lindsay, looking a little sad.<br />
"Really? Oh my..." said Zyoox, really scared and shocked, "My daughter is there, my wife too... Why did I leave?" said him, talking to himself, worried.<br />
"When I left my planet, everything was good and peaceful there.<br />
Everyone being good to each other, I traveled here to gather some resources and explore, it was some months ago.<br />
My spaceship is still on this planet.<br />
Why did that happen... I thought we had a deal with the Gek," said him, talking to himself.<br />
"Hmm... I feel sorry for you, Zyoox," said Ana, looking sad at him, "We had a person who taught us all these things, how to fly the spaceship, use the Exo suit, and the multi-tool," continued Ana.<br />
"The name of that person was Tetracovix," said Lindsay.<br />
"Really? He's my brother!" said Zyoox, surprised, smiling a little.<br />
"Is he still... Alive?" asked Zyoox, looking at Ana and Lindsay with an uncertain face, a little sad.<br />
"Yes... He is on our planet, surviving.<br />
Like, building nature things with wood and grass, eating fruits and stuff," replied Ana.<br />
"But... He's a Korvax... He doesn't need fruits to eat, he eats electricity...<br />
I mean, this is just a myth among the Korvax," said Zyoox, confused.<br />
"Oh... Really?" asked Ana, surprised, "Maybe he just likes to do survival stuff then," said Ana.<br />
"Anyway, we gotta go out there, right?" asked Zyoox, "If he taught you all these things, then probably he called you two to fight for Gears of the Korvax," said him.<br />
"Yes, he asked for us to fight and take his planet back," said Lindsay.<br />
"Oh, okay, do you guys want to go there now?" asked Zyoox.<br />
"Yes, we don't have much time, they need our help!" replied Ana.<br />
"Okay, thanks for fighting with us!" said Zyoox, smiling, he shook the hand of Ana and Lindsay.<br />
"No problem, hehe," said Ana.<br />
"Don't worry about it," said Lindsay, smiling.<br />
<br />
Ana and Lindsay walked to their spaceship, Ana turned the spaceship on and took flight, she stayed hovering inside the planet, waiting for Zyoox to get on his spaceship.<br />
Ana scanned the planet with the planetary scanner, the name of that planet was "Rochesk Alpha", it was a deserted planet.<br />
Zyoox got on his spaceship, took flight, and stayed behind the spaceship of Ana and Lindsay.<br />
Ana pushed the accelerator and turned the spaceship upwards, aiming out of the planet, she flew out of the atmosphere, out of the planet, then she stopped the spaceship.<br />
Zyoox stopped too, Ana flew to the Gears of the Korvax planet, where the Korvax and the Geks were fighting, Zyoox followed her.<br />
Lindsay was a little scared, Ana arrived close to the planet, entered the atmosphere, and stayed flying on the planet.<br />
Ana saw some spaceships, they did not look like spaceships that the Korvax used, they saw a Gek piloting it.<br />
Ana grabbed the steering wheel of the spaceship firmly and pushed a button on it, shooting lasers at the spaceship.<br />
Zyoox did that too, there were four Gek spaceships there, they destroyed all of them.<br />
Then Ana, Lindsay, and Zyoox flew close to some Korvax, they landed their spaceships there.<br />
Ana and Lindsay walked close to an injured Korvax sitting on the ground.<br />
"What happened?" asked Ana, looking at the Korvax.<br />
"The Gek simply invaded our planet, they brought their spaceships here and started killing the Korvax... Ugh...<br />
We had a deal with them, but they broke it.<br />
When they arrived here, their chief said that someone was spying on them, saying that it was a Korvax.<br />
He also said that we stole a rare item from them, so they came back here for vengeance," replied the Korvax, in shock, hardly being able to speak.<br />
"Also, nice to see you're back, Zyoox... Ugh..." said him, in pain.<br />
"Calm down," said Ana, "We are here to help you," continued her.<br />
"Ah, thanks Traveler, I appreciate your help..." said the Korvax, getting calmer.<br />
"So, what is your name?" asked Lindsay.<br />
"My name is Yetsby," replied the Korvax.<br />
"Do you know where my brother is?" asked Zyoox, getting closer to them.<br />
"Yes, he is at the central Korvax station, your spaceship can guide you to there," replied Yetsby, giving two identical devices, one for Ana and one for Zyoox.<br />
"But... Is he there? He was at our planet," asked Ana, confused.<br />
"Well... We Korvax can teleport wherever we want, using teleport guns that we point to where we wanna go, and we can teleport back to our home too.<br />
Where he was at your planet?" asked Yetsby.<br />
"Well... He was at a desert island, it had sand, and a forest in the middle, the sand was around the forest," replied Ana.<br />
"Oh, maybe he built a portal there, we can bring a lot of things with us, especially in the Exo suit.<br />
He probably built a portal there using the elements that he had inside the Exo suit, so he teleported back home," said Yetsby.<br />
"Oh, okay... Thank you, Yetsby," said Ana.<br />
"No problem Travelers," said Yetsby, looking at them.<br />
A Gek appeared there, Ana, Lindsay, and Zyoox prepared their multi-tools to fire, Yetsby aimed at the Gek with his multi-tool and shot, killing him.<br />
After that, Ana and Lindsay walked to their spaceship, entering inside it, and using the device, a waypoint appeared on the spaceship map.<br />
Zyoox did the same, Lindsay turned the spaceship on, taking flight and pushing the accelerator to drive to the central Korvax station where Tetracovix was, Zyoox followed them.<br />
Ana and Lindsay looked at the ground while flying, seeing Geks shooting Korvax, and Korvax shooting Geks.<br />
There were sad looking at that, "It looks like one of the wars that we had, right sis?" asked Lindsay, sad, piloting.<br />
"Yeah..." replied Ana, looking at the ground.<br />
<br />
After some minutes flying, they arrived there, the spaceships automatically parked themselves on the parking lots that existed in the station when they pressed the park buttons.<br />
They got out of their spaceships and walked inside the planetary station, finding Tetracovix there, laid on the ground with electricity coming out of his body, some cables of his body were disconnected.<br />
Zyoox dropped his multi-tool while running fast to Tetracovix, "Brother?... Stay with me..." said Zyoox, noticing that he was injured.<br />
Ana and Lindsay looked sad at him, they sat on the ground, close to Zyoox, "Is he going to be alright?" asked Lindsay.<br />
"Yes... I just need to give him some energy and connect his cables," said Zyoox, connecting the cables of Tetracovix, sharing some of his electricity with Tetracovix.<br />
The Life Support device of Tetracovix was also out of energy, Zyoox gave him elements, he recharged the device.<br />
Tetracovix got up and grabbed his multi-tool, he was getting better, "Thanks, Ana, Lindsay, and my brother..." said Tetracovix.<br />
"Thanks for coming here, you two," said him, looking at Ana and Lindsay, "I knew you could do this, I knew you were brave enough".<br />
"No problem Tetracovix, how did you get here?" asked Lindsay.<br />
"I built a portal to here in the island that you two were before, I had brought the necessary materials to build the portal there.<br />
I just needed some organic material to turn the portal on, like some wood, or fruits," replied Tetracovix.<br />
"Oh, that's cool, hehe," said Ana, smiling.<br />
"So, what we should do now?" asked Lindsay.<br />
"There are still some Geks on the planet, but the war is ending.<br />
We need to get into our spaceships to search for them.<br />
We will spare the ones that lasted and will apologize for the war, we'll tell them that it was all a lie.<br />
That we didn't spy on them and didn't steal the rare item from them.<br />
We will get spaceships, items, and elements of dead Gek for us," replied Tetracovix.<br />
Then they walked out of the station, Ana and Lindsay walked to their spaceship, entering it, Ana turned the spaceship on and took flight.<br />
Zyoox entered on his spaceship, Tetracovix too, they both turned their spaceships on, taking flight.<br />
The trio of spaceships started flying around the planet, looking for Geks and their spaceships.<br />
They found some Geks and explained everything to them, they declared peace between the races, and then got out of the planet with their spaceships.<br />
Tetracovix and Zyoox collected the elements and items, they got the empty spaceships to them.<br />
The trio of spaceships got out of the planet, they flew to the space station.<br />
The group parked their spaceships inside the parking lot of the station, Zyoox and Tetracovix got out of their spaceships to warn the Korvax on the station of what happened.<br />
After that, the Korvax that were in the space station walked to their spaceships and turned them on, taking flight and flying back to their home planet.<br />
Lindsay sat on the driver's seat, turning the spaceship on and taking flight, Zyoox and Tetracovix did that too, all of them flew back to the planet of the Korvax.<br />
They arrived there, they all got out of their spaceships, Lindsay and Ana were standing in front of their spaceship.<br />
Zyoox and Tetracovix were looking at them, they thanked them for helping save the planet and the Korvax race.<br />
They gave a reward to Ana and Lindsay, it was a yellow crystal that had a plumb bob shape, they did not know how it worked or what it did.<br />
"When the right time comes, you will know how to use this crystal, and it will help you," said Tetracovix, looking at Ana and Lindsay.<br />
"Thanks, Tetracovix," said Ana, smiling and accepting the gift.<br />
They both said to Ana and Lindsay that they were welcome there, on the planet of the Korvax, if they wanted to go there for a visit, or to stay there, they said that Ana and Lindsay were their friends.<br />
"You guys can keep the spaceship, the multi-tools, and the Exo suits, they are all yours, and they are a gift for helping us, you can visit us anytime," said Tetracovix.<br />
"Thank you, Tetracovix, it was a pleasure to help you two and your people, and thank you for the gifts," said Lindsay smiling.<br />
"No problem hehe," said Tetracovix, smiling at Lindsay.<br />
Then they say bye to Tetracovix and Zyoox, the two brothers walked back to the planetary station, smiling, happy to be together again and to be victorious.<br />
Lindsay and Ana walk to their spaceship, Ana sat on the driver's seat, turning the spaceship on and taking flight.<br />
Then Ana started flying back to her planet, happy that she helped someone, she wrote everything she learned and saw in a notebook.

All the fairies were in shock, looking at that strange thing, they had never seen something like that.<br />
Ana and Lindsay got out of the spaceship, Ana said "We had a big adventure today, and we discovered a lot of things!"<br />
Panda walked close to them to hear.<br />
Then Ana explained everything to them, she explained to the fairies that there were space and other planets other than theirs.<br />
"There is a lot of planets out there, there are space and stars, other races, not just the fairies and the other races on this planet," said Ana.<br />
"I have a friend who is of the Korvax race, they are very technological, he teleported to this planet because another race was trying to kill it.<br />
Its name is Tetracovix, and the name of its brother is Zyoox.<br />
He gave us this spaceship, our multi-tools, and our Exo suits, he taught us everything about what is beyond the sky, about the spaceship, other races, he was very kind.<br />
We managed to help it and its people fight the Gek race which was trying to kill its people, invading its planet.<br />
We had a big adventure, it was good to discover that there's something more than our planet and our sun, we got a lot more insightful.<br />
I have recordings of the fight, flying with the spaceship, talking with the Korvax.<br />
There is a big space and universe out there for us to explore, there are a million suns for us to see," continued Ana, who showed the fairies all the recordings that she had made with the Exo suit.<br />
The fairies did not believe what they were seeing, all of them looked at the recordings, showing the spaceship of Ana flying, the battle with the Gek, Tetracovix, and Zyoox talking.<br />
Ana showed them the pictures of the planets, of their planet from inside the spaceship, far away and big, she showed pictures of the Gears of the Korvax planet and the planet where she stopped to refill the spaceship.<br />
The fairies were amazed by seeing all of that, they knew about a lot of things now, all of that knowledge opened their minds.<br />
"My daughter, you're so smart, you studied the crystals and brought that knowledge to us...<br />
Then you studied about space, the universe, the other races, the Korvax, and the Gek, you learned about spaceships, multi-tools, Exo suits, and all of those things.<br />
I'm so proud of you my daughter," said Jena, hugging Ana tight and caressing her hair, smiling, Ana returned the hug.<br />
"And I'm also proud of you, you protected your sister from the danger, and helped her with all of those things," said Jena, hugging Lindsay, caressing her hair too, smiling.<br />
"Thanks, mom, it was a great adventure with a lot of dangers, but it was good, and we were together.<br />
It was dangerous, but what matters is that we're safe now," said Lindsay, looking at Jena.<br />
"Hehe, thanks, mom, she protected me properly, hehe," said Ana, smiling and looking at Jena.<br />
Jena thought about all those things, about what she could do now.<br />
If she could send people to other planets to register and discover them, to look for other good places to live.<br />
Panda walked close to them, "Hey sis, where you two have gone?" asked her.<br />
"We flew to a planet called Gears of the Korvax, it was the planet where the Korvax lives," replied Ana, looking at Panda.<br />
"Oh, that's very interesting, sis, can I go the next time you go on those big adventures?" asked Panda.<br />
"Of course sis, hehe," said Lindsay.<br />
"Thanks," said Panda, who hugged Ana and Lindsay.<br />
Ana and Lindsay taught the fairies how to use the Exo suit, the multi-tool, and the spaceship.<br />
They taught a lot of fairies how to drive the spaceship, how to use its systems, and also taught about the universe, planets, stars, the sun.<br />
The fairies could use the multi-tool to mine the crystals easily and collect their elements.<br />
After an afternoon of teaching, Ana and Lindsay were tired, they grabbed their Exo suits and multi-tools, Ana parked the spaceship close to the hut of her mother.<br />
Panda, Ana, Lindsay, and Jena lay on their beds, they slept while listening to the birds and the ocean.<br />
<br />
They woke up in the morning, Ana walked to the kitchen to prepare breakfast, she prepared and ate it, nobody at her house had woken up.<br />
She flew to the house of the nutritionist to make a check-up, she made some tests, he gave her the list of nutrients that she needed to eat from the crystals, what crystals she needed to eat, and how many of them.<br />
After that, Ana walked to the beach where some crystals existed, she was wearing her Exo suit, she grabbed her multi-tool, mining some blue, red, and yellow crystals.<br />
Then Ana opened the inventory of her Exo suit, eating the elements that the crystals gave her.<br />
Lindsay, Panda, and Jena woke up, they walked to the kitchen and saw that the breakfast was ready.<br />
They ate breakfast, Lindsay and Panda flew to the beach, looking for Ana.<br />
The two found her, "Hey, what are you doing, sis?" asked Lindsay, looking at Ana, curious.<br />
"I'm just collecting the crystals that the nutritionist said that I needed to eat, did you guys make a check-up already?" asked Ana.<br />
"I still didn't," replied Lindsay, "Me neither," replied Panda.<br />
"Oh, you better make it quick so you can start eating the crystals," said Ana.<br />
"Yeah, do you want to do something today sis?" asked Lindsay, curious.<br />
"Yes, I want to go to an island, do you guys wanna go with me?" asked Ana, curious.<br />
"Yeah, I want to!" replied Lindsay, smiling, "Me too!" said Panda, smiling too.<br />
"Did mom eat breakfast?" asked Ana.<br />
"Yeah, we all ate, it was very delicious sis, thanks!" said Panda, smiling.<br />
"No problem, sis, we should tell mom that we're going to an island," said Ana.<br />
Then they flew to the hut of their mother, they found her there, sat at the table of the kitchen.<br />
"Hey mom, we're all going to an island, okay?" asked Panda.<br />
"You'll go too? Okay, take care of your sisters, Ana," said Jena.<br />
"Okay, I'll take care of them, they're gonna be good," said Ana.<br />
Then Ana got out of the hut, she started flying high on the Crystal Lands, Lindsay and Panda followed her.<br />
She wanted to go back to the island where she and Lindsay built survival things, Ana held her necklace and closed her eyes.<br />
Ana felt where the island was, she started flying there, the other two followed her.<br />
They arrived at the island, landing on the beach.<br />
"Is this the island that we're gonna stay in?" asked Panda, curious.<br />
"No, I just wanted to go back here for a visit, this is the island that I and Lindsay stayed on.<br />
And was the island where Tetracovix asked us for help, to fight in its planet," replied Ana, looking at the things on the island.<br />
"Oh, that's very interesting, I want to see the things that you and Lindsay made," said Panda.<br />
Then Ana started walking on the island, her sisters too, Panda looked at the furnace campfire.<br />
Ana saw a deactivated portal with a purple border, Tetracovix probably used it to go back home.<br />
The girl walked to the hut in the forest, Panda looked at it, she wanted to build something like that.<br />
She looked at the ax, the stone knife, and the spear, asking herself how to build that.<br />
Then Ana got out of the hut and started flying to another island, one that she had not built things on, her sisters followed her.<br />
<br />
The trio arrived at the island, landing on the beach, they looked at its trees and the forest, the sand.<br />
It was a good place to stay, the wind was good, it was chill and the breeze was fresh.<br />
Ana started walking on the island, she walked to the forest, the two followed her.<br />
"We need a sharp stone to cut a tree to make an ax," said Ana.<br />
Then the trio started looking for a sharp stone, Panda found one, she was happy.<br />
Ana walked to a good tree that could be used to make an ax handle, she told Panda to go there.<br />
Panda and Lindsay walked there, Ana told Panda to put the sharp stone on the tree to cut it and hit it with a thick tree branch.<br />
Then Panda did that, she managed to cut the tree, Ana told her to cut the tree in half.<br />
Panda cut it in half and made a hole on the half log, then she started looking for a rectangular stone in the forest.<br />
Lindsay grabbed a big stone and soaked it in the water of the ocean, she came back to the forest where there were shadows.<br />
After that, Panda found a rectangular stone, she grabbed it and walked close to the big stone, sitting on the ground.<br />
She started sharpening the rectangular stone to use it as an ax blade.<br />
Then Panda grabbed the ax handle and the blade.<br />
The girl grabbed a thick tree branch, putting the ax blade inside the hole on the handle, hitting it with the branch.<br />
"I did it, sis, I did it!" said Panda, excited and happy that she managed to make an ax.<br />
"Yes, you did it, sis, I'm so proud of you, hehe," said Ana.<br />
Then Panda walked to a tree, she started to cut it, rotating the ax around the tree with each hit, she brought the log to where Ana and Lindsay were.<br />
"Can you teach me how to make fire, sis?" asked Panda.<br />
"Of course sis," replied Ana, "First we need some sticks, tree branches, and dry leaves".<br />
Then Ana, Panda, and Lindsay started looking for everything that they needed.<br />
"Hey, I found some here!" said Lindsay.<br />
"Good work, sis!" said Ana, smiling.<br />
The trio brought the sticks, tree branches, and dry leaves to one place, leaving the things on the ground.<br />
Panda started arranging the sticks and branches like a campfire, she left two sticks out.<br />
Then Panda grabbed one stick and the stone knife, she cut three holes in the stick.<br />
She placed the two sticks on top of the dry leaves.<br />
After that, Panda placed one stick on one of the holes of the other one, she started rotating the stick very quickly inside of the other.<br />
Then smoke came out of the dry leaves, Panda grabbed them and started to blow them gently.<br />
After the fire appeared, Panda left the burning dry leaves on top of the sticks and branches, she added more sticks to fuel the fire.<br />
She finished making a fire, Panda was very good at it, she was happy to learn these new things from her sister.<br />
"Thanks, sis, I like to learn with you, hehe," said Panda, looking back, smiling at Ana.<br />
"No problem, sis, I love to teach you new things.<br />
You're a natural, learn so fast, hehe," said Ana, smiling.<br />
Then Panda started walking to the forest to search for some mud, she found it and grabbed some, bringing it close to the fire.<br />
After that, Panda left a big stone close to the fire, she made some bricks with the mud and left them drying on the big stone, close to the fire.<br />
Succeeding the drying of the bricks, she placed them in a furnace shape around the fire, then she grabbed more mud, she made two jars of mud and three cups.<br />
Then she walked to the ocean and filled both of the jars with water, Panda walked to the furnace campfire and placed one jar on top of it.<br />
The water started to boil, she removed the jar with two pieces of wood, then she waited for the water to chill, it was afternoon.<br />
Lindsay placed the other jar on top of the furnace, waiting for the water to boil.<br />
Ana made two lids for the jars, she left them close to the fire to dry.<br />
Panda filled the three cups with the water of the jar that has boiled, the trio drank the water, it was very good and refreshing, the chill weather had chilled the water quickly.<br />
The water on the other jar started to boil, Lindsay removed it from the fire with two pieces of wood and left it on the sand for it to chill.<br />
"How about we make a house?" asked Panda.<br />
"That's a great idea, sis," replied Ana.<br />
"I and Ana made a grass hut on the other island, I think you saw it right?" asked Lindsay.<br />
"Yeah, I saw it, it is very beautiful!" replied Panda, smiling at Lindsay.<br />
"What do we need first, sis?" asked Panda, looking at Ana.<br />
"First we need a lot of logs, twenty-five I think," replied Ana.<br />
"Okay, so let's get cutting!" said Panda, excited.<br />
<br />
She started to cut a lot of trees with the ax, giving it to her sisters sometimes for them to cut trees too.<br />
They finished cutting the twenty-five logs that they needed.<br />
Then Panda walked to a good and flat place in the forest, she started cleaning the ground to make the house there.<br />
After that, Panda placed four logs inside the ground in a square shape on the place she cleaned.<br />
Then she made two holes in the middle of both of the two logs that would be the sides of the hut.<br />
Panda then placed the central and higher log in the middle of the two logs, where would be the front of the hut.<br />
Then she made the same with the back of the hut, placing the central log on the middle of the two logs.<br />
Lindsay walked to the forest and grabbed some vines to use as mooring.<br />
Panda placed a 2-meter log on top of the central posts, linking one to another, she used the vines to fix the two posts together.<br />
Then Lindsay grabbed a log, she linked one of the walls to another using the vines and the log.<br />
Ana made the same, using the vines and one log.<br />
After that, Lindsay grabbed six logs, she made three rafters with two logs on each one of them.<br />
Then the trio placed the three rafters on top of the hut, one on the front of the hut, one on the middle, and one on the back.<br />
After that, Panda made more posts to stabilize the structure, putting them in the middle of the two points of the hut, the first four initial logs, on the walls of the sides.<br />
Then she made some smaller beams on the sides of the hut, on the walls, to hold the grass that would be the roof.<br />
Panda then made two more stabilizing posts in the middle of the central log that holds the roof, one on the middle of the left side, and one on the right side, making the back of the hut.<br />
Then the trio walked to a mountain that existed on the island, they used the stone knife to cut some grass that existed in that mountain, getting a lot of packs of grass.<br />
After that, they walked back to the hut and started placing the grass on its roof, joining it to the roof frame using vines.<br />
They overlaid the grass on top of each other to protect from rain, then they covered the top of the hut with grass to fill the gaps, lifting the grass with a tree branch.<br />
Then they cut some wood with the ax, they used the wood to make the walls weaving in and out on the logs of the walls, leaving the front of the hut with no walls, for entrance.<br />
They grabbed some gray mud to plaster the walls, plastering all of them, it was late afternoon.<br />
Mud stays on provided the roof keeps the rain off, they plastered the floor with mud to make it flat and clean.<br />
Panda made some fire inside the hut to dry the floor, the walls, and the roof, smoke also deters bugs.<br />
Then the trio grabbed the ax, stone knife, jars of water, and the cups, they brought them to the hut, leaving them on the ground.<br />
Lindsay and Ana were sitting on the floor, drinking some water, Panda walked out, she walked close to a tree and grabbed three bananas.<br />
Then Panda walked back to the hut, she sat on the ground and gave one banana to each one of her sisters, they ate the bananas while drinking water.<br />
It was very relaxing, Panda, Lindsay, and Ana smiled, it was really good to survive with each other.<br />
Not to survive, because they were not having any necessity, they had everything that they needed.<br />
But it was good to do survival stuff together, to create things together.<br />
They lay on the ground, looking at the roof, those beautiful grass bunches.<br />
"It is very relaxing to spend some time on an island like this, surviving, building stuff," said Panda, smiling.<br />
"Yeah, I agree sis," said Ana, smiling too.<br />
"It is very good, even better with you guys, hehe," said Lindsay, smiling at her sisters.<br />
They slept on the island, looking at the ground, closing their eyes.<br />
They started dreaming about a world of crystals, a world filled with crystals that grew on the ground, they had different candy tastes.<br />
Some of them tasted like chocolate, some like bubblegums, jellybean, Brazilian candy.<br />
It was very delicious to spend some time in that place with lots of crystals, they ate crystals every day.<br />
Sometimes huge chocolate bars fell from the sky, all the fairy kids enjoyed eating the delicious chocolates.<br />
There were white chocolate, black chocolate, normal chocolate, lakes of chocolate milk, trees with sprinkled chocolate in the place of the leaves.<br />
It was being a very good dream, Panda, Lindsay, and Ana looked at each other, they were happy while dreaming that dream.<br />
They were so connected spiritually, as sisters, that they dreamt together.

		After some hours of sleeping, Ana woke up, it was morning, the sun was slowly rising.<br />
It was raining a little, the fire of the hut was still on.<br />
Ana grabbed the ax and walked outside of the hut, she walked to a tree.<br />
The girl cut the tree, bringing the log close to the hut.<br />
Then, Ana looked up in the sky, she saw some dark clouds, they looked like the Clouds of Madness.<br />
She knew that the Clouds of Madness did not exist close to that region.<br />
After looking at the clouds, Ana entered the hut, she grabbed her cup and filled it with water.<br />
The girl drank some sips of the water, she left her cup on the ground of the hut.<br />
She walked to the forest, getting close to a river and grabbing some mud.<br />
Then, she walked to the furnace campfire, leaving the mud on top of a big stone.<br />
Ana ignited the fire, she made a lid of mud, placing it on top of the furnace to dry.<br />
She sat close to the fire, it was a little cold in there, she hugged herself, the fire felt good and warm.<br />
Lindsay appeared there, "Did you wake up already, sis?" asked Lindsay, rubbing her eyes.<br />
"Yeah, hehe," replied Ana, her voice was a little shaky because of the cold weather.<br />
"Good morning, sis.<br />
What are you doing?" asked Lindsay, who sat beside Ana.<br />
"Good morning, sis.<br />
I'm just making a lid for my cup, do you want one too?" asked Ana.<br />
"Yeah, it would be bad if a bug landed on my cup, hehe," replied Lindsay.<br />
"Yes, but I think it's a little cold in here, I don't see many bugs around here," said Ana, hugging herself.<br />
"Oh, yeah," said Lindsay.<br />
"Will you teach Panda how to make a spear?" asked Lindsay.<br />
"Yeah, hehe, I'll wait till she wakes up," replied Ana.<br />
Then Ana walked to the forest, she walked to the same river where she got the mud.<br />
Ana grabbed some mud and came back to the furnace, sitting on the ground and making two lids.<br />
She placed the lids on top of the furnace, leaving them to dry.<br />
"It's a little cold in here, right?" asked Lindsay, hugging herself.<br />
"Yeah, I think we have to make a door for the hut, the wind is very cold in here," replied Ana.<br />
<br />
After some minutes, Panda woke up, she looked for her sisters, walking to where the furnace was.<br />
"Hey, good morning you guys," said Panda, rubbing her eyes.<br />
"Good morning, sis," said Lindsay and Ana in unison.<br />
"What are we gonna do today, sis?" asked Panda.<br />
"I'm gonna teach you how to make a spear so you can catch fish," replied Ana.<br />
"Oh, okay, what do we need?" asked Panda.<br />
"We need a thin tree to cut, to make the spear with it," replied Ana.<br />
Then Panda started looking for a thin tree, she had the ax in her hand.<br />
She found one and cut it down, bringing the log to Ana.<br />
Ana told her to insert the tip of the spear into the fire to char the blunt tip.<br />
Panda did that, she scraped the tip of the spear in a rock to sharpen it, just like Ana said.<br />
After that, Panda sat on the ground and grabbed a piece of wood, polishing the tip of the spear with it.<br />
Then, Panda showed the spear to Ana, "It's ready, sis," said Panda.<br />
"Oh, it's very good, you're so talented, sis!" said Ana, smiling at Panda.<br />
"Thanks, hehe," said Panda.<br />
Then Ana walked to the coast of the island with Panda, she was going to teach her how to catch fish.<br />
Ana told Panda to wait patiently for the water to get calm, then hit a fish with the spear.<br />
Panda did that, she moved the spear very quickly and caught a fish, she was happy.<br />
"Yay! You did it sis!" said Ana, happy and proud of Panda.<br />
"Yeah, hehe," said Panda, happy too.<br />
Then Ana told Panda to make another campfire, so she can cook the fish, she told Panda to make a spit of the fish.<br />
Panda placed two thin logs on a place on the sand, she also placed one on the top of both of the logs, the two had a Y shape.<br />
She made some fire with sticks and leaves, after that, Ana told Panda to skin the fish, she did it and placed it on the spit.<br />
After some time, the fish was cooked, Panda removed it from the stick and placed it on a clean big stone.<br />
Panda caught two more fishes, for Ana and Lindsay, she also skinned them and placed them on the spit, one at a time.<br />
Then, after waiting, the fishes were ready, Ana, Lindsay, and Panda started to eat them, it was delicious.<br />
After that, Ana thought of coming back home, she thought about paying a visit to Tetracovix on its planet.<br />
"Hey, Lindsay, what do you think of us paying a visit to Tetracovix and Zyoox?" asked Ana.<br />
"I think it's a good idea, sis, it's sad that Panda can't come," replied Lindsay, looking at Panda.<br />
"Oh, Tetracovix is that Korvax that asked you two for help in fighting the Gek race right?" asked Panda, looking at her sisters.<br />
"Yeah, you can't come because our spaceship only has seats for two people, and we have only two Exo suits," replied Ana.<br />
"Oh, okay, I think I'm gonna come home then, hehe," said Panda.<br />
Then Ana held her necklace and closed her eyes, setting a yellow waypoint on the island with the name "The Trio of Survival".<br />
<br />
Lindsay and Panda could know where this waypoint was, after that, the trio started flying back to the Crystal Lands.<br />
Ana held her necklace to know where it was, after some time flying, they arrived there and landed on the sand.<br />
The trio flew to the hut of Jena, entering inside it, Jena was sitting on a chair in the kitchen.<br />
"Hey mom, we arrived from our journey to an island, hehe, I taught a lot of things about survival to Panda," said Ana.<br />
"Oh, that's good, hehe, I'm happy that you three had fun and arrived safe," said Jena.<br />
"I and Lindsay are gonna pay a visit to Tetracovix, it's been some days since we saw him.<br />
We can't bring Panda with us because the spaceship only has two seats, and we have only two Exo suits," said Ana.<br />
"Oh, okay my dear, you guys gonna go there now?" asked Jena.<br />
"Yeah, hehe," replied Lindsay.<br />
"Did you three have breakfast?" asked Jena.<br />
"Yes, we ate some fish at the island," replied Panda.<br />
Then Ana and Lindsay wore their Exo suits and grabbed their multi-tools that were in their bedrooms.<br />
After that, they walked to the kitchen, saying bye to their mother and leaving the house, walking to the spaceship that was landed close to the hut.<br />
Ana and Lindsay entered the spaceship, using the Launch Thruster for lift-off.<br />
Then, Ana pushed the accelerator of the spaceship, pointing it upwards, flying off the planet.<br />
She started flying out of the atmosphere of the planet, she saw the planet of the Korvax, pointing the spaceship to it and accelerating.<br />
After some minutes of flying, they arrived there, the trading post of the planet was marked on the screen of the spaceship.<br />
Ana started flying there, she pressed a button to land the spaceship on the landing pad.<br />
Then Lindsay and Ana got out of the spaceship, they walked inside of the trading post.<br />
Tetracovix was there, sitting at a chair, Zyoox too.<br />
"Hey, you guys came!" said Tetracovix, happy by seeing Ana and Lindsay.<br />
"Yeah, hehe," said Ana, Zyoox said hello to Ana and Lindsay.<br />
They started to talk a little, talking about what they did recently.<br />
Tetracovix said that he bought a new and better spaceship for him using the universal currency which is Units.<br />
"Hey, Tetra, how can we buy a new spaceship? And a new multi-tool, we want to bring our sister to space, hehe," asked Ana.<br />
"Oh, you have to buy the spaceship and multi-tool with Units," replied Tetracovix.<br />
He and Zyoox explained to Ana and Lindsay what the Units were, saying that they were used to buy spaceships, freighters, resources, and products from the Galactic Trade Terminals.<br />
And also for purchasing Exo suit and multi-tool upgrades on the Space Stations.<br />
"Oh, okay, how do we earn Units?" asked Lindsay.<br />
"You can earn Units by mining resource deposits and selling the items, farming, and also can search for Artifacts on the underground to salvage and sell the items.<br />
You can also find Storm Crystals on extreme weather planets when storms are happening, but they are very dangerous," replied Tetracovix.<br />
"Oh, we gonna try it then, we want to buy a new spaceship for our sister," said Ana.<br />
"How is your sister called?" asked Zyoox.<br />
"Her name is Panda, she is also a fairy from Earth, from the Crystal Lands," replied Lindsay.<br />
Then the quartet talked for some time, Ana and Lindsay said bye to Tetracovix and Zyoox.<br />
<br />
They both walked out of the trading post, they entered inside their spaceship, Lindsay pushed a button to lift off the spaceship.<br />
She started flying to Rochesk Alpha, the planet where they stopped to refuel the spaceship that time.<br />
Lindsay entered the atmosphere of the planet, she got low enough and started flying around the planet.<br />
Then she stopped on a trading post that existed on the planet, landing the spaceship there.<br />
Ana and she got out of the spaceship, Lindsay walked to the trading post, she was going to ask for some information from the Korvax there.<br />
Ana opened the Analysis Visor of her Exo suit and started looking around the planet for some markers of resource deposits.<br />
She found one, her Life Support system was almost empty, she collected some oxygen from a nearby plant to refuel the system.<br />
Lindsay finished talking with the Korvax, he gave some directions to Lindsay so she could find a resource deposit on the planet.<br />
Then Lindsay got back to the spaceship, she entered it, Ana too, Ana lifted the spaceship off.<br />
Ana started flying to where Lindsay told her the resource deposit was.<br />
After some time flying, they arrived there, Ana landed the spaceship.<br />
Then they started mining the resource deposit of cobalt with the Terrain Manipulation tool of their multi-tools.<br />
Both of them gathered a lot of Cobalt, then they entered inside the spaceship, Lindsay lifted it off.<br />
She flew out of the planet, flying to a space station, Lindsay entered inside it.<br />
After that, the spaceship automatically landed itself on a landing pad, Ana and Lindsay got out of the spaceship.<br />
They walked to a Galactic Trade Terminal and sold all of their Cobalt.<br />
The sisters gained a lot of money doing that, they sold two hundred and fifty Cobalt and earned forty-nine thousand Units.<br />
They continued doing that for some time, mining Cobalt and selling it, trying to crash the market, they gathered ten thousand Cobalt, one full stack of Exo suit inventory.<br />
Selling Cobalt on the space station and buying it back with a price reduced up to eighty percent.<br />
After some time, they earned five hundred thousand Units, they wanted to buy a spaceship called "Transparent Hand QX1" for Panda.<br />
It cost thirty-two million Units, they started flying around planets searching for it.<br />
Then, after some time searching, they found the spaceship, Lindsay gave her money to Ana and Ana bought the spaceship.<br />
Ana said that she was going to drive the spaceship, Lindsay entered inside the Alpha Vector, which was the spaceship that Tetracovix gave to them.<br />
Ana entered inside the Transparent Hand QX1 spaceship, they both started driving back home, bringing the spaceship to Panda.<br />
They had to teach Panda how to drive the spaceship when they arrive there.<br />
They also learned how to make Exo suits and give them to people, and had bought some multi-tools with their spare money.

		Ana and Lindsay came back to Earth, landing their spaceships on the beach of the Crystal Lands.<br />
Some fairies looked at them, surprised, "A new spaceship?" wondered a fairy, looking at the spaceship which was called "Transparent Hand QX1".<br />
The sisters got out of the spaceships, walking to the hut of their mother, they arrived there.<br />
Panda was eating afternoon breakfast with Jena, Ana and Lindsay had the spare multi-tools that they bought inside their Exo suits.<br />
"Hey, mom, me, and Lindsay bought some multi-tools, they can mine the crystals and extract their elements.<br />
Who do I give them to?" asked Ana.<br />
"Oh, you can leave them in a box, I'll put some miners to collect the elements and store them in special containers on the warehouse," replied Jena.<br />
"Oh, okay," said Ana, who grabbed a box from the storeroom, she placed the box in the kitchen, depositing the multi-tools there.<br />
Lindsay also did that, they had bought thirteen multi-tools in total.<br />
After that, Lindsay and Ana started eating together with Jena and Panda, it was some bread with cheese and some chocolate milk.<br />
The fairies also knew how to take care of the cattle, when the first fairies arrived at the Crystal Lands, they found the animals there, then the fairies started herding the cattle.<br />
They did not kill the cattle, only used their milk, and also got eggs from chickens.<br />
"So, how it was? Visiting Tetracovix," asked Panda, looking at Ana and Lindsay.<br />
"Oh, it was very good, we had a lot of news to talk about, Tetracovix said that he bought a new spaceship that was better than his previous one," replied Ana.<br />
"How did he buy the spaceship?" asked Panda.<br />
"He bought it using the universal currency called Units, it is used as money all around the universe," replied Lindsay.<br />
Ana explained to Panda how the Units currency worked, how they can buy spaceships, multi-tools, and upgrades for the Exo suit and multi-tool.<br />
After some time, they finished eating, Ana told Panda that they had bought a spaceship for her, so she can accompany her and Lindsay on their adventures.<br />
Jena stayed in the hut, the trio walked to the beach to see the spaceship, Ana gave an Exo suit and a multi-tool to Panda.<br />
Ana wanted to teach Panda how to pilot the spaceship, she was going to drive the spaceship with Panda in the backseat, looking at her driving.<br />
Then Ana started teaching Panda, driving while she was looking, being on the backseat, explaining to her what each of the spaceship buttons did.<br />
After that, Ana told Panda to sit on the driver's seat, she sat on the passenger's seat, Lindsay walked to the hut of her mother.<br />
Ana started giving instructions to Panda on how to turn the spaceship on, lift it, accelerate, and steer it.<br />
Lindsay and her mother walked to the hall of the village, Jena called all of the crystal miners, they mined with pickaxes.<br />
Jena said that they were going to use multi-tools now, and Exo suits to store the elements that come from the crystals.<br />
Lindsay then gave one multi-tool to each one of the miners, she also created Exo suits for them to store the elements.<br />
They were going to mine the crystals and store the elements in special containers inside their inventories, and then retrieve the items, placing them in the warehouse.<br />
The miners tested the multi-tools on some crystals that were nearby, they could collect the elements from the crystals.<br />
<br />
After that, Lindsay walked to the beach to see how Panda was going on Ana's driving lesson.<br />
She was going well, she could fly very fast without crashing or bumping into things, she circled the island with the spaceship, Ana was on the passenger's seat.<br />
Then, after some time of flying, Panda landed the spaceship on the beach, Ana and Panda got out of it.<br />
"Wow, our sister is very good at driving, sis, hehe," said Ana.<br />
"Oh, I'm proud of her, hehe, it looked like she was having fun up there," said Lindsay, looking at Panda.<br />
"Yeah, I was, hehe, I never drove a spaceship, or anything else, before," said Panda.<br />
It was late afternoon, almost night, Ana told Panda to park her new spaceship close to Alpha Vector, the spaceship of Ana and Lindsay.<br />
Panda piloted her spaceship and parked it close to her mother's hut.<br />
Ana, Panda, and Lindsay walked to the warehouse, they showed their nutritional prescription papers to the warehouse manager.<br />
He grabbed the three papers and walked inside the warehouse, coming back with three small boxes of wood.<br />
He then gave the boxes and papers to the trio, they started walking back to the hut.<br />
After that, they arrived there, leaving their boxes on the kitchen cabinet.<br />
Each one of the boxes had their names written on them, the fairy nutritionist used empty boxes to make the element packs.<br />
The fairies needed to return the empty boxes after one month because there were thirty elements of each type.<br />
They would ingest one element of each type per day.<br />
It was night, Jena made dinner with the help of Ana, it was some roasted fish with vegetables.<br />
The whole family ate dinner together, talking a little.<br />
Ana was thinking about the yellow crystal that Tetracovix gave to her, she wondered what it did.<br />
After eating dinner, the family walked out of the hut, walking to the beach where there were some handmade area chairs.<br />
They sat on those chairs, feeling the cool wind, it was not very cold, they could look at the beautiful big moon close to the ocean.<br />
Then, after waiting for some minutes, they got up, walking back to the hut.<br />
Ana, Lindsay, Panda, and Jena walked to their bedrooms to sleep, Jena locked the hut.<br />
Ana was happy to sleep using the warm blanket, it was so good to see the big moon on the horizon.<br />
<br />
After sleeping for some hours, it was morning, Ana and Lindsay woke up, they did their morning necessities.<br />
Then they started to prepare the breakfast.<br />
They had some hominy there, it already has been cooked, soaked, and dried, it was soft.<br />
(Hominy is maize that has been dried and then gone through a process called nixtamalization, where the kernels are soaked in an alkaline solution to remove the hull and germ, causing the grains to swell to about twice their normal size.)<br />
Ana and Lindsay wanted to make some Canjica, which was a Brazilian dessert that the indigenous people knew how to make.<br />
(Canjica, pronounced kan-jee-ka, or Mugunzá in the Northeast of the country, is a Brazilian dessert made of white corn, milk, sugar, and spices, it is very popular in Festas Juninas.)<br />
They added the hominy inside a pot along with whole milk, some ground cocoa, and some sugar.<br />
After that, they lit up the fire of the wood-fired oven, cooking the Canjica while stirring the ingredients.<br />
Then, after some minutes, they finished making the Canjica, it was creamy and consistent.<br />
Jena and Panda woke up, they did their morning necessities.<br />
After that, the family sat at the table to eat, the Canjica was warm, good to eat on a cold morning.<br />
Ana was happy to eat the Canjica with her family, it was delicious.<br />
Then, after some minutes, they finished eating, Jena was going to the hall of the village to take care of some leader business.<br />
Panda walked to the beach to play some beach volleyball with her fairy friends.<br />
Ana started washing the dishes, Lindsay started sweeping the hut.<br />
After some minutes, Ana finished washing the dishes, she and Lindsay ingested their daily capsules of crystal elements.<br />
Panda had already ingested hers after breakfast, Jena too.<br />
Ana wanted to go to other planets to collect minerals and make money, she asked if Lindsay wanted to go too.<br />
Lindsay said yes, they walked to the beach and asked if Panda wanted to go, she said yes.<br />
Then the trio walked to the village hall, looking for their mother.<br />
They found her, said that they were going to another planet to collect things to earn some money.<br />
Jena said okay, telling Lindsay to take care of her sisters.<br />
<br />
After that, the trio walked to the hut, Ana told Panda to follow her with her spaceship.<br />
Panda sat on the driver's seat of her spaceship, Lindsay sat behind her to help if she needed it.<br />
Ana entered inside the Alpha Vector and took off, Panda did the same.<br />
Then Ana started flying outside of the Earth, Panda following her.<br />
Ana was heading to Rochesk Alpha, she wanted to earn Units to buy another spaceship and give to the fairies.<br />
She wanted to give a spaceship to an explorer, cataloger, and historian fairy.<br />
So they can make discoveries about the planets, the galaxy, and the universe, to register everything, writing it on paper.<br />
She wanted the fairies to know the universe and other planets.<br />
The girl thought that they would write books to register their discoveries, and those books would be used to teach universe history in fairy schools.<br />
Ana continued flying, she arrived at Rochesk Alpha, entered its atmosphere, and started flying around the planet.<br />
She was searching for a resource deposit of some rare mineral, she found one of Cobalt.<br />
The girl continued flying to the resource deposit, she landed the spaceship close to it, Panda did the same.<br />
Lindsay, Ana, and Panda got out of the spaceships, Lindsay taught Panda how to use the inventory and how to refill the systems of the Exo suit, multi-tool, and the spaceship.<br />
After that, the trio started collecting the Cobalt from the resource deposit using the Terrain Manipulation tool of their multi-tools.<br />
Then, they got inside their spaceships again, flying to a trading post, selling all of the Cobalt.<br />
They continued mining, collecting, and selling, trying to get some Units to buy another spaceship.<br />
After some hours of mining, they thought it was afternoon because in space there is no way to know the time.<br />
Time is relative to the planet, each planet has a size and the size changes the length of the day.<br />
The trio managed to earn some millions of Units, Ana said that it would be good to buy another "Transparent Hand QX1" for an explorer fairy to use.<br />
Because it had more Hyperdrive bonus, so the fairy explorers could travel further in the universe, traveling to farther galaxies.<br />
Then the trio flew around the planets and the space station of that galaxy, trying to find a spaceship like the one of Panda.<br />
After some time flying around, they found one, Ana and Panda gave their Units to Lindsay, she bought the spaceship.<br />
She had some Units left, she divided them with Ana and Panda.<br />
Then Lindsay said that she was going to take the spaceship home.<br />
Ana was in the Alpha Vector, Panda was in one Transparent Hand QX1, and Lindsay was on the other one.<br />
They flew back to Earth, entering its atmosphere, and landing on the beach of the Crystal Lands.<br />
Ana got out of her spaceship, it was still afternoon, Jena was on the beach, sunbathing.<br />
Ana told her mother that she bought another spaceship, Lindsay and Panda got out of their spaceships.<br />
"Hey, mom, do you know if we have a fairy that knows a little about exploring and cataloging?" asked Ana.<br />
"Oh, I guess so, I'll make a reunion to see it, you bought the third spaceship to give to an explorer?" asked Jena.<br />
"Yeah, hehe, I wanted the fairies to explore the universe and discover everything about it.<br />
I thought that the explorer fairies would make a book to explain everything about the planets, galaxies, and universes," replied Ana.<br />
"Oh, I'm so proud of you my dear, thanks, I'll search for an explorer fairy then.<br />
But you will have to teach the fairy how to drive the spaceship, hehe," said Jena, smiling.<br />
"I'll sure do, mom, hehe, I liked to teach Panda how to drive her spaceship," said Ana, smiling too.<br />
Then the trio entered inside the spaceships, lifting them and parking them close to the hut.<br />
After that, the sisters walked inside the hut to eat afternoon breakfast, they were happy about the adventure they had, to buy another spaceship.<br />
They started to have afternoon breakfast together, it was delicious.

		It was morning, Ana did not know what day it was, but she knew that she was living in the year 2052, her Exo suit said that.<br />
She woke up and got out of bed, doing her morning necessities, after that, she walked to the kitchen to eat breakfast with her family.<br />
The family started eating, it was delicious, some bread with some vegetables.<br />
"Hey, my dear, I already put a fairy in charge of being an explorer, you'll have to teach her how to drive the spaceship," said Jena.<br />
"Okay mom, will do," said Ana.<br />
After eating breakfast, Jena left the hut to do her fairy leader things in the center of the village.<br />
Lindsay and Panda were going to play some ball at the beach, Ana thought that the breakfast was delicious.<br />
She walked out of the hut and walked to the center of the village, searching for the new explorer fairy.<br />
"Hey," said a fairy who was leaning against a tree.<br />
"Hi," said Ana, who walked to the fairy, "So you're the new fairy explorer?" asked Ana.<br />
"Yeah," replied the fairy, she looked like she was at the age of Ana.<br />
"So, wanna learn how to drive the spaceship?" asked Ana.<br />
"Okay, let's go," replied the fairy, she had yellow hair and yellow wings, Ana and her started walking to the hut.<br />
"I'll bring the spaceship to the shore of the island, follow me," said Ana, who entered the spaceship and turned it on, lifting it.<br />
Ana flew to the shore of the island and landed the spaceship there, the fairy followed her.<br />
After that, Ana got out of the spaceship and told the fairy to sit on the driver's seat.<br />
"What's your name?" asked Ana.<br />
"My name is Petra, what's yours?" asked Petra.<br />
"Mine's Ana," replied Ana, then she started teaching Petra about the commands of the spaceship, what the buttons did.<br />
After a bit of theory, Petra was ready to fly, Ana guided her on how to lift the spaceship, turn it, and accelerate.<br />
She was very good at piloting the spaceship, after that, she landed the spaceship on the ground as Ana said.<br />
Then Ana gave an Exo suit and multi-tool to her, she taught her how to use both.<br />
After that, Petra thanked Ana, she smiled, Ana said no problem, smiling too, looks like Ana made a new friend.<br />
Ana then walked back to the hut, she was a little tired, she took a bath, it looked like it was afternoon, the driving lesson took some hours.<br />
<br />
The girl wanted to go on an adventure today, but she wanted to go alone, she flew to the beach and found Lindsay and Panda.<br />
"Hey, sis, is it okay if I want to go on an adventure alone?" asked Ana to Lindsay.<br />
"Oh, it's okay sis, I'm gonna miss you," replied Lindsay, hugging Ana.<br />
"Me too," said Panda, hugging Ana too.<br />
"Where are you going?" asked Lindsay.<br />
"I'm gonna pay a visit to Tod, and then I'm gonna explore the world a little," replied Ana.<br />
"Okay, I'm gonna tell mom so she does not get worried okay?" asked Lindsay.<br />
"Okay sis, also tell her that I already taught the new explorer fairy how to pilot the spaceship, how to use the Exo suit and multi-tool," replied Ana.<br />
"I love you two," said Ana, hugging Lindsay and Panda.<br />
"We love you too, sis," said Panda and Lindsay.<br />
After that, Ana held her necklace, her wings appeared and released glitter, she started flying high in the sky.<br />
Ana held her necklace to know where Tod was, she started flying in that direction.<br />
Then, after some minutes of flying, Ana arrived at the Mountains of Aris, she landed on the beach.<br />
Ana noticed that all of the Kódeks were in their humanoid forms, she found that weird, the Kódeks would never stay in their humanoid forms in public.<br />
"Hey, do you know where Tod is?" asked Ana to a Kódek.<br />
"Yes, he is at the village center, there," replied the Kódek, pointing to the village center.<br />
"Thanks," said Ana smiling, "No problem," said the Kódek, it was a girl.<br />
After that, Ana started walking to the center, she found Tod there, he was also in his humanoid form, his mother, Sophia, was there too.<br />
"Hey, Tod, what happened?" asked Ana in a low voice.<br />
"Heey Ana, good to see you, what? Oh, the Kódeks.<br />
Well, I showed them that we do not have to be ashamed of who we are, of our true nature, being humans, or humanoids.<br />
Of, course, being a bird has its advantages, like flying, or not having much hunger, being able to eat a lot of things found in nature.<br />
But I showed them that we can be ourselves and not hide our true self because of an old race that cursed us," replied Tod, who hugged Ana.<br />
"Oh, that's very interesting, you really did change this place, right? Hehe," asked Ana.<br />
"Yeah, I'm very happy, hehe, and I'm happy that you're here with me to see this.<br />
Want me to show you the place?" asked Tod.<br />
"Sure, hehe," replied Ana.<br />
<br />
Then they began walking around the place, humanoids and humans were walking around, doing their things.<br />
There were humans and humanoids painting things, playing songs with acoustic instruments, dancing around, there was one human selling fruits and vegetables in exchange for pearls.<br />
It was beautiful to see, everyone being free and not ashamed of themselves, Ana was happy.<br />
They continued walking and arrived at the library, which had a lot of humanoids reading books.<br />
Ana remembered that the library was quite empty the last time she visited it, she was happy to see the Kódeks looking for knowledge.<br />
The Soul Wasp of that day, Rose, was there, reading a book, she looked at Ana and waved her hand while smiling, Ana did the same.<br />
"Do you wanna read a little?" asked Tod.<br />
"No, thanks, hehe," replied Ana, smiling.<br />
"Okay, hehe," said Tod, then he began walking to the center of the village, Ana followed him.<br />
They sat at a bench in the center, there was some acoustic music playing in the background.<br />
"So, any news?" asked Tod.<br />
"Yeah, I discovered that there were more planets on the galaxy, and... That a galaxy existed, hehe, and also a universe.<br />
I discovered that the name of our planet is Earth, Crystal Version, and our galaxy is Milky Way.<br />
I also discovered that other races exist, other than the ones that live on this planet, there are the Korvax and the Gek.<br />
I helped the Korvax fight the Gek that invaded their planet, on the Gears of the Korvax planet.<br />
Also, I received a spaceship, Exo suit, and multi-tool from a Korvax friend of mine, Tetracovix.<br />
I bought a spaceship for my sister to use using Units, which is a universal currency.<br />
Us fairies started mining crystals with multi-tools and collecting their elements to eat, it's very nutritional.<br />
I bought another spaceship to give to an explorer fairy, so she can explore and catalog the universe," replied Ana.<br />
Then Ana explained to Tod about the spaceships, Exo suits, multi-tools, the Korvax, and the Gek.<br />
"Oh, that's very interesting, hehe, thanks for saying that, do the fairies have a book explaining about that?" asked Tod.<br />
"No, that's why my mom, the leader of the fairies, put an explorer fairy in charge of, well... Exploring.<br />
I'm gonna give you a copy of the book when it's ready, hehe," replied Ana.<br />
"Oh, thanks, that will be great knowledge for us Kódeks, for us to teach the kids about the universe, at school," said Tod.<br />
"No problem, hehe, hey Tod, I think I'm gonna leave to explore the world a little bit, okay?" asked Ana.<br />
"Okay, good luck, hehe," replied Tod, who got up, Ana got up too.<br />
"See you soon, Tod, I'm gonna miss you, hehe," said Ana, blushing a little while smiling.<br />
"See you soon, Ana, I'm gonna miss you too," said Tod, smiling and hugging her.<br />
After that, Ana said bye to Sophia, the mother of Tod, held her necklace, and started flying high.<br />
<br />
Ana began flying to somewhere unknown, she flew to the North, the Mountains of Aris were behind her, on the South.<br />
She continued flying around the planet, it was late afternoon, Ana arrived at an island, it looked good to stay, she landed on it.<br />
The girl walked around it, she started making some survival things, grabbing wood and sharpening a stone to make an ax, she sat on the ground, putting the sharp stone on the handle.<br />
While doing that, Ana felt a weird tremble on the ground, she was at the beach, the girl looked at the forest, there was a green light shining on the ground there.<br />
She got up and walked to the forest, looking at the light, the girl started digging a little, it looked like there was something buried there.<br />
The girl came back to the beach and finished making her ax, she grabbed a stone and looked for a big stone.<br />
Ana made some fire and grabbed some mud, making a bowl of mud, she grabbed some water with the bowl and started carving the stone.<br />
She sharpened the stone to look like a blade of a shovel, then she made a handle for the shovel, finishing making it.<br />
Ana started digging the place where the green light shone, she found an old stairwell made of stone.<br />
She dug more to free the place so she can enter, Ana made a torch using a stick and tree resin, lit it, and walked down the stairwell.<br />
The hall after the stairwell was a little narrow, the girl saw some markings on the walls, they looked like ancient writings.<br />
From her interpretation, it looked like an ancient race ruled the world or that continent, and there were markings of what looked like humans, and birds after those markings.<br />
Ana remembered that Tod told her that an evil race ruled the planet, and transformed the Kódeks into birds, it looked like those markings told that story.<br />
She felt that rumble again, and saw a green light shining, she continued walking forward.<br />
After walking for some time, there was no more way forward, she found an entrance to the right.<br />
Ana entered a room that had a green light lighting up the place, she saw creatures that were trapped inside glass tubes that had some kind of green liquid.<br />
Those creatures were sleeping, floating inside the tubes, they had something on their face, Ana thought that it was something for them to breathe better and not breath the green liquid.<br />
It looked horrible, maybe that liquid preserved the body of the creatures, some creatures looked like humans, and had some weird clothes, there was a creature that looked like a wolf, but smaller.<br />
Behind the glass tubes, there was a glass tube in the form of a big ball, it looked like there was a green liquid inside the big glass tube, but denser, it was not full.<br />
Ana walked closer to the glass tubes, looking at them, she walked to the middle one, it looked like there was a boy there.<br />
He had brown pants, a yellow t-shirt, and a blue hoodie, he had brown hair, Ana was sad by seeing him trapped there.<br />
<br />
There was a table on the left, it had some papers and pictures, Ana did not know how those pictures existed, she only knew how to take pictures with her Exo suit, not put them on paper.<br />
She looked at the pictures and tried to read the words on the paper, it looked like a strange language.<br />
"I'm writing this on the year 2029, this is test forty-nine, testing the preservation of bodies using the green liquid called Greent, it is better than cryogenic preservation.<br />
I already put my son here to test if he would be alive after some months, I still have to drain the liquid to see if his body was preserved," read a note.<br />
Ana did not understand those words, it looked like an ancient language, Ana and the other creatures of planet Earth had their language, it was not English.<br />
The words were written with some type of black ink, it looked like burnt wood.<br />
There was one note that looked recent, the ink, or burnt wood was still fresh, Ana grabbed it and tried to read it.<br />
"I'll leave this note here, I'm writing very fast because there are some people of the United Kingdom invading here, they have sound guns.<br />
They're trying to steal the reserves of Greent to use for their good," read the note.<br />
Ana held her necklace and closed her eyes, trying to understand the words, "Dear necklace, please help me read these things, I wanna understand them," thought her.<br />
After that, she opened her eyes, trying to read the notes again, she understood them, the person who wrote that was living in 2029.<br />
He or she placed their son there to test the liquid, some other race, maybe humans, invaded the place and tried to steal the Greent, the body preservation liquid.<br />
"So how are the creatures and the liquid still here?" asked Ana to herself.<br />
"Hmm, maybe the father or mother of that son, that child, managed to protect this place and the glass tubes, cause they loved the boy," said Ana.<br />
She walked to a place that looked mechanical, close to the glass tubes, she wanted to release the boy.<br />
Ana looked around for a button, like in her spaceship, to release the creatures, she found a switch behind the metal base of the glass tube where the boy was.<br />
She moved the switch up, the green liquid, or Greent, was sucked out of the glass tube, from the ground, the big glass tube was filled a little with that liquid.<br />
Ana thought that the liquid of the big glass tube stood still for quite some time, that is why it was dense.<br />
The boy was standing, being held by the tubes of the breathing mask on his face, Ana opened the glass door and removed the mask from the boy.<br />
She hugged him and got him out of the glass tube, leaving him on the ground, he started coughing a little, he sat on the ground and looked at Ana.<br />
He was a little scared, getting away from Ana, "Who are you?" asked the boy, Ana was holding her necklace to understand him.<br />
"I'm Ana, a fairy from this planet, I wanted to help you get out of that glass tube, I didn't like to see you trapped there," replied Ana.<br />
"Oh..." said the boy, who looked at the glass tubes, he looked at the tube with the "wolf", getting up and walking to it, "Pingo..." said him, sad, looking at the wolf on the glass tube.<br />
"Is that your wolf?" asked Ana, looking at the boy.<br />
"Wolf? This is a dog, it's a... Domesticated wolf, that evolved through the years, to be more gentle with humans and kids," replied the boy.<br />
"Oh, a dog... I didn't know what that was," said Ana.<br />
<br />
"What year are we living on?" asked the boy.<br />
"In 2052, I guess," replied Ana.<br />
"Oh? My father put me and my dog on those tubes in 2028, to test the preservation liquid... I didn't want to, but he said that it was for science.<br />
I don't know where he got the other animals, but, well... It looks like the preservation liquid works, I'm still alive," said the boy.<br />
"Oh, I understand, I read some notes on the table here, it looked like the people of the United Kingdom, I guess, invaded this place, trying to steal the liquid.<br />
They did not get the liquid, that's why there are still are creatures here, he probably died trying to save you... Or maybe he escaped," said Ana.<br />
"Hmm... The United Kingdom, they were very evolved in the field of guns, sound guns, and other types of weapons.<br />
They did not know how to preserve the human body like the United States, the place where I was born, that's why they tried to steal us.<br />
I also remember that my father and his scientist friends transformed the people of China into birds, and they managed to kill a lot of Chinese, they even split their continent into two.<br />
They were having a war with China because of power, money, and natural resources, they sent a bomb to China... It was sad..." explained the boy.<br />
"Oh, I understand... I know people who were transformed into birds, they are a race called Kódeks.<br />
They can transform into humans, humanoid birds, and birds, maybe that was the Chinese?" asked Ana.<br />
"Yeah, they're who my father transformed into birds," replied the boy.<br />
"Oh, okay, what is your name?" asked Ana.<br />
"My name is Tom," replied Tom, the boy.<br />
"Okay, Tom, hmm... I guess the world has changed a lot since 2029, right? Like, there are a lot of different races now, there are the Kódeks, Fairies, Soul Wasps, Stone Ogres.<br />
And there are fewer humans, there's no technological stuff like your ancient humans had, right?" asked Ana.<br />
"Yeah, I think it changed a lot, in fact, I remember my father talking about creating new races of humans, new forms of them.<br />
He made some experiments, and they failed, the modified humans were deformed or died after being modified.<br />
Maybe some experiments worked and that's why these races that you told me about exist, you're a fairy, and you're beautiful, you don't have flaws in your skin or are deformed," replied Tom.<br />
"Oh, yeah, I think that's true, so, you wanna get out of this place to see the new world?" asked Ana.<br />
"Yeah, I just need to get my dog back," replied the boy, he walked to the glass tube where his dog was and flipped the same switch that Ana did, the green liquid was sucked and the boy opened the glass door.<br />
Tom removed the breathing mask from the dog and grabbed him, Pingo coughed a little and opened his eyes, looking at Tom, licking his face in excitement.<br />
Ana had brought a backpack with her, she got up and walked to the table, grabbing some papers, pictures, and what looked like the writing tool that those humans used.<br />
She stored everything in her backpack, the boy found a pet carrier on the ground, he wore it and placed Pingo, his dog, inside it.<br />
The two got out of the place, Ana had left the torch inside, she grabbed the shovel and started burying the stairwell.<br />
"Let's bury this so no one finds out," said Ana.<br />
"Okay," said the boy.<br />
"What is your age?" asked Ana.<br />
"I have, hmm, thirty now, I guess, because of the body preservation liquid, in 2033, I had eleven, what about you?" asked the boy.<br />
"I have nineteen," replied Ana.<br />
After burying the hole, Ana threw the shovel far away, to not give the sense that something was buried there, she placed fruit and a stone there to mark the region.<br />
Then, Ana walked to the beach, Tom followed her, she held her necklace and placed a waypoint there, called "The Scientific Experiment Island".<br />
"I'm gonna bring you to the Crystal Lands, okay? It's my home, where the fairies live," asked Ana.<br />
"Okay then," replied the boy.<br />
After that, Ana started flying, she grabbed the boy and started flying to the Crystal Lands, her home.

		Ana was still flying with the boy that she rescued from the underground laboratory, Tom, she was flying to the Crystal Lands.<br />
The boy was inside a glass tube filled with a green liquid called Greent, that liquid could preserve the body better than cryopreservation.<br />
The fairy rescued him and discovered a lot of things about her past, and the past of the world, of Earth.<br />
After some minutes of flying, Ana and Tom arrived at the Crystal Lands, they landed on the beach.<br />
Jena was there, Lindsay and Panda were playing some ball at the beach, the boy released his dog and it went walking through the island to get used to the place.<br />
"Who is this boy, Ana? He doesn't look like a fairy," asked Jena.<br />
"He is a boy that I rescued from an underground laboratory, he was inside a glass tube with a green liquid, it preserved his body, his name is Tom.<br />
There were some papers on a table close to the glass tubes, I read them and discovered that was the ancient humans that created us.<br />
They created us as experiments of making new races and creatures, they had a war on the world and probably extinguished themselves.<br />
And the other creatures stayed alive, and evolved, I discovered that where the Kódeks live right now, was China before the great war.<br />
Also, it was the ancient humans who transformed the Kódeks into birds, they were humans before that," replied Ana.<br />
"Oh, my dear, you always discover a lot of things when you go on adventures, hehe, I'm so proud of you.<br />
Does he have any relation to the ancient humans?" asked Jena.<br />
"Yeah, he is the son of a scientist of the United States, he put his son and his dog into a glass tube, to test the green liquid, which is called Greent," replied Ana.<br />
"What is a dog?" asked Jena, Ana was holding her necklace for Tom to understand what they were saying.<br />
"Oh, a dog is just like a wolf, but domesticated, and smaller, to be able to live inside homes, and with humans, to be docile with kids," replied Ana.<br />
Then Ana explained more things about the great war, the past, and the ancient humans, she explained that to all of the fairies.<br />
Ana also placed the papers and pictures on the big table of the village hall to explain to the fairies, she was happy to talk about history.<br />
"Well, I think we gotta look forward to the future and discover more things about it.<br />
But we also gotta focus on the past and learn with it, right sis?" asked Lindsay, looking at Ana.<br />
"Yeah, I agree sis, hehe," replied Ana.<br />
(Yeah, future = space, past = ocean, the ocean, and past is what we humans can reach, the future and space are someplace we have to build things to gain access to that knowledge.<br />
We can access our past through stones, fossils, old writings, and objects, and we have something we don't know fully, which is our ocean, the deepest parts.<br />
And it's right here on Earth, we can reach it if we want.<br />
Future and space are something we have to build upon, we have to build spaceships and tech to reach the future and space.)<br />
"Hey, mom, I think there still are some creatures left on the glass tubes, to be rescued.<br />
Do you think you could send explorer fairies to that island to rescue them?<br />
I think there were some Kódeks and Soul Wasps inside the tubes," asked Ana.<br />
"Oh, yeah my dear, I'll send them, can you go with them to help?" asked Jena.<br />
"I also will leave historian fairies here to study the papers and pictures of the ancient humans.<br />
I don't understand this language, what is it?" asked Jena.<br />
"Okay mom, I'll go with them, this is English, you have to hold your necklace and ask it to help you understand the language," replied Ana.<br />
A fairy was in charge of taking care of Tom, he was going to stay at her house.<br />
<br />
After that, Jena told some explorer fairies to go with Ana, she started flying high, holding her necklace, she continued flying to the scientific experiment island.<br />
The explorer fairies followed her, Ana was wearing her Exo suit and had her multi-tool in hands, the explorer fairies too.<br />
Then, after some minutes of flying, they arrived at the island, landing on the beach, Ana walked to the place where the ancient stairwell was.<br />
"It is here, I buried it," said Ana, looking at the explorer fairies, she grabbed the shovel on the beach and walked back to the forest.<br />
Ana started digging the ground, after some minutes, the stairwell appeared, Ana and the fairies entered the hole, and started walking on the hall.<br />
"I brought some shining crystals," said an explorer fairy, she flew high and placed the blue shining crystals on the roof of the hall, to light it up.<br />
They continued walking forward, then, they arrived at the room, Ana walked to the glass tubes.<br />
She showed the fairies how to release the creature on the glass tube, turning the switch, a Soul Wasp was inside that tube.<br />
The green liquid on the glass tube was sucked into the big glass tube on the back of the room, Ana opened the glass and removed the mask of the Soul Wasp.<br />
"Where am I?" asked the Soul Wasp, she had a purple color and shone in purple too.<br />
"You are inside an underground laboratory, the ancient humans placed you in this tube to test a body preservation liquid," replied Ana.<br />
The other fairies began to release the other creatures on the glass tubes.<br />
"Oh, I remember that, I lived in the continent of Brazil, and I was asked to do this test, I accepted because I wanted to see what technology we would have in the future.<br />
I was asked by the team of scientists of the United States, and they placed me here.<br />
What year are we living on?" asked the Soul Wasp.<br />
"We're living in 2052, what is your name?" asked Ana.<br />
"My name is Hellen," replied the Soul Wasp, "What is yours?" asked her.<br />
"My name is Ana, I am a fairy, another creature that was created because of the experiments of the ancient humans.<br />
They created the Fairies, Soul Wasps, Kódeks, and Stone Ogres," replied Ana.<br />
"I remember that too, they were trying to create creatures that were better than them physically, and had some powers like magic," said Hellen, the Soul Wasp.<br />
"Where did you learn all of that?" asked Hellen.<br />
"I learned with a boy of thirty years old, called Tom, he talks in English, I could understand him because I have this necklace," replied Ana, looking at her necklace.<br />
"Oh, Tom, the son of the leader of the scientific group," said Hellen.<br />
"So, you're a Soul Wasp, other Soul Wasps are living in another continent, do you wanna go there?" asked Ana.<br />
"Yeah, I wanna go there to meet my people, and to tell them about what happened with me, and also to tell the story of the ancient humans," replied Hellen.<br />
"Oh, okay, hey guys, I'm gonna bring her to Jar of Petals, you can manage here, right?" asked Ana.<br />
"Yeah, we gonna explain the things to the creatures and bring them back to the Crystal Lands," replied an explorer fairy.<br />
"Okay, so, let's go?" asked Ana, looking at Hellen.<br />
"Sure," replied her, holding Ana's hand, they walked outside, Ana grabbed Hellen, she started flying high, to Jar of Petals.<br />
After some time, they arrived there, Ana landed on the beach, Hellen walked to the Soul Wasps, she started explaining the things that she knew.<br />
The Jar of Petals was very beautiful, it had dark purple rocks, crystals, and gems, it had a lot of trees too, it looked like the Soul Wasps were very spiritual, and meditated too.<br />
"Can I leave a waypoint here?" asked Ana.<br />
"What is a waypoint?" asked Hellen.<br />
"It is a way for me to know where this continent is," replied Ana.<br />
"Oh, okay, we'll see each other soon, right?" asked Hellen.<br />
"Yeah, hehe," replied Ana, smiling, they said bye to each other, Ana began flying, back to the island where the creatures were.<br />
<br />
Ana arrived there, she entered inside the hole, it was very illuminated by the blue crystals, she arrived at the room.<br />
There were fewer fairies and fewer creatures, there was one creature left to be brought to the Crystal Lands.<br />
She walked to the glass tube and turned the switch, opening the glass door and removing the mask.<br />
Ana got the creature out of the glass tube and explained everything to it, it talked about how it was placed there, and what happened to it.<br />
After that, Ana and three more fairies grabbed the four remaining creatures, they walked out of the underground laboratory and started flying high, back to the Crystal Lands.<br />
Then, after some minutes of flying, they arrived at the Crystal Lands, landing on the beach.<br />
Ana and the other fairies reunited the creatures in the center of the village, Jena and a historian fairy explained everything to them.<br />
They had mounted the entire story of the ancient humans, the great war, and the scientific experiments, all based on the notes, pictures, and the people reports.<br />
Ana was happy to be making history, and to be discovering the secret of the past, and knowing about what happened.<br />
She knew where she came from, and how the fairies and other creatures were created.<br />
The fairies offered home to the creatures, some decided to stay, and some wanted to go back to their native continents, to their people.<br />
The Soul Wasps flew back to Brazil, the continent where the Soul Wasps were created.<br />
Some Kódeks flew back to what was China, to tell the story to the local Kódeks.<br />
A Kódek decided to stay on the island of the fairies, the Crystal Lands, it was called Gerald.<br />
Ana explained to him that the modern Kódeks did not have the shame of being humans or transforming into humanoid birds or humans in front of others.<br />
Then, he transformed himself into a human, the fairies had given him a free house to live in.<br />
Ana taught him how to cook, get food, and plant, it was how the fairies got food, from trees, plants, and other things.<br />
He was happy to live at the Crystal Lands, the fairies were cool and interesting.<br />
Gerald also studied in the fairy school, where they taught about the universe, galaxy, planets, science, the Exo suits, multi-tools, spaceships, the universal currency called Units.<br />
They taught about outer space things and related technologies, but more recently, also taught about the past.<br />
About the story of the ancient humans who created the green liquid Greent, and who created all of the creatures that exist now in the world.<br />
And about the great war that happened between some nations of the old world, and how the humans extinguished themselves and left the planet for the other creatures to live.<br />
The explorer fairies came back to the island with the underground laboratory to collect a little Greent, for the scientist fairies to study and analyze.<br />
Ana was very happy to see the fairies making progress, and evolving in all fields, of history, and science.<br />
She was happy to help them make discoveries and study about the past, future, and science.<br />
It was night, Ana was in her room on the hut, Jena, Lindsay, and Panda were sleeping.<br />
Ana was thinking about all of her discoveries, the things she did, meeting Tetracovix, knowing about the universe and the planets.<br />
She also discovered the secret of the crystals, and the fairies started eating crystals.<br />
The girl flew to that island and discovered the past of the Earth, the world.<br />
She was so happy to make a lot of discoveries and happy to think about everything she has done in these months, until now.<br />
So much time has passed, and she met a lot of new people, made new friends, the girl closed her eyes, sleeping, waiting for a new day.

		It was another day on Earth (Crystal Version), Ana woke up, got up, and walked to the bathroom, she did her morning necessities.<br />
Then she walked to the kitchen, Ana started making breakfast, it was morning.<br />
She was thinking of yesterday, about the discoveries she made and the fact that she met Hellen, a Soul Wasp that was trapped inside the underground laboratory.<br />
After some time, Ana finished making breakfast, Panda and Lindsay had already done their morning necessities, they walked to the kitchen.<br />
Jena woke up, she did her morning necessities, the family was in the kitchen, sitting at the table.<br />
Ana had made some skillet potatoes with peppers, they ate it with coffee and milk, it was delicious.<br />
Jena said that Petra, the explorer fairy that received the spaceship that Ana bought, started exploring the universe and cataloging it.<br />
Ana was very happy to hear that, she wished luck for Petra in her mind.<br />
After that, Ana walked out of the hut, she walked to the beach, Lindsay and Panda followed her.<br />
The trio sat on area chairs, they relaxed in the shade, feeling the cool wind.<br />
Jena walked to the village center, she started talking about some things with the worker fairies.<br />
The historian fairies started translating the English language to the native language of the fairies with the help of the necklace.<br />
Then, after the historian fairies finish translating the English language, the teacher fairies would start teaching history to the kids in school, and also English.<br />
After some time relaxing, Ana got up, she walked to the hut, Lindsay and Panda followed her.<br />
"Hey, do you guys wanna go earn some Units to buy a new spaceship with me?" asked Ana, looking at her sisters.<br />
"Oh, okay," replied Lindsay.<br />
"I think I'm gonna stay here at the island, in case mom needs help with something," replied Panda.<br />
"Okay sis," said Ana, who hugged Panda and said bye, Panda said bye back, Lindsay also said bye to Panda.<br />
Ana and Lindsay walked inside the hut and wore their Exo suits, they also grabbed their multi-tools.<br />
After that, Lindsay and Ana walked out of the hut, they entered the Alpha Vector spaceship, Lindsay sat on the driver's seat, Panda waved her hand to Lindsay and Ana, saying bye.<br />
Lindsay and Ana waved bye back to Panda, smiling, Lindsay was happy to see Panda happy.<br />
She turned the spaceship on, lifted it off, and started flying out of the planet, Lindsay started flying to the Rochesk Alpha planet.<br />
There were still some resource deposits there for them to mine.<br />
<br />
After some time flying, Lindsay arrived there, she entered inside the atmosphere of the planet.<br />
Lindsay looked around the planet with the visor of the spaceship, she could see the resource deposit icons on the glass of the spaceship.<br />
She flew to a resource deposit of Cobalt, Lindsay landed the spaceship there, she and Ana got out of the spaceship.<br />
They began mining the resource deposit, a Korvax appeared there, it asked what they were doing.<br />
Lindsay said that they were mining Cobalt to earn some Units, to buy another spaceship.<br />
The Korvax said okay, and told to Lindsay where the closest trading post was.<br />
Lindsay said thanks, she smiled, then, the Korvax walked back to his base.<br />
Ana and Lindsay had the Life Support device on the Exo suit, it helped them stay alive, and they did not need to eat when they are wearing the Exo suit.<br />
The sisters finished mining the resource deposit, Ana and Lindsay walked to the spaceship, Ana was driving, she flew to the trading post that the Korvax talked about.<br />
After that, the two sisters sold their Cobalt, earning some Units, they began mining resource deposits around the planet and selling them, trying to crash the market.<br />
They earned some Units, Ana managed to buy another Alpha Vector, it was gray with red details, the Alpha Vector of Lindsay was gray with blue details.<br />
Ana said that she was going to bring it back home, Lindsay said that she was going to stay on the planet, mining more, earning more Units.<br />
"Oh, okay sis, do you need some Units? I have some millions left," asked Ana.<br />
"No, I'm fine, thanks, I have some millions too, hehe," replied Lindsay.<br />
"Okay, hehe, I thought about bringing it back home and coming back here, but how? If I already brought the spaceship there, hehe.<br />
So I'm gonna pay a visit to Tetracovix, okay? I'm gonna be at the Korvax trading post number two hundred thirteen," asked Ana.<br />
"Okay sis, bye-bye!" replied Lindsay, hugging Ana, smiling.<br />
"Bye-bye, hehe," said Ana.<br />
After that, Ana entered her spaceship, turned it on, lifted it off, and started flying out of the Rochesk Alpha planet.<br />
Ana started flying to the Gears of the Korvax planet, she entered inside its atmosphere and flew to the trading post number 213.<br />
The girl landed her spaceship on the landing pad, she got out of it, walking inside of the premises.<br />
Petra was there, Ana was surprised, Petra had a notepad in her hands.<br />
"Hey, Petra, what are you doing in here?" asked Ana, walking closer to Petra.<br />
"Oh, hey Ana, good to see you here, I was cataloging and learning about the history of the Korvax and the Gek.<br />
I flew here to check this planet, and to see if it had anything interesting to know about, like history.<br />
And I discovered that the Korvax knew a lot about the history of the universe, and I started asking them about it, hehe," replied Petra.<br />
"Oh, that's interesting, hehe, good luck then!" said Ana, smiling.<br />
"Thanks! Hehe, and what are you doing here?" asked Petra.<br />
"Oh, I'm just here to visit my Korvax friends, Tetracovix and Zyoox," replied Ana.<br />
"Okay, hehe, I'm gonna ask more about the history of the universe to some Korvax, see you later, Ana!" said Petra, smiling.<br />
"See you later, Petra!" said Ana, then Petra walked out of the trading post.<br />
<br />
Ana walked around the place, she found Tetracovix and Zyoox, they were sitting on some chairs that looked very futuristic.<br />
"Heey, guys," said Ana, smiling.<br />
"Heey, Ana, you're here, hehe," said Tetracovix, who appeared to be smiling and happy, based on the tone of his voice.<br />
Zyoox also said hi to Ana, she sat on an empty chair, looking at the two, they began talking.<br />
Tetracovix asked about the news, Ana said that she and Lindsay bought a spaceship for their sister.<br />
And that they also bought another one to give to an explorer fairy.<br />
Ana said that she discovered the past of her planet, and about the origin of her and the other creatures, about the underground laboratory.<br />
She talked about the ancient humans who created the green liquid and used it to preserve the body of creatures.<br />
And also about the boy called Tom, which was an ancient human, and that his body was preserved because of the green liquid called Greent.<br />
Tetracovix was surprised to hear that, he was happy and intrigued, and also interested.<br />
He talked about a fairy who appeared there and said that she asked the Korvax about the story of the universe and their past.<br />
Ana said that it was her friend Petra and that she is the explorer fairy to who Ana gave the spaceship.<br />
Tetracovix said that they talked a lot and that Petra was happy to learn about the history of the universe, the Korvax, and the Gek.<br />
Lindsay was still mining, she grabbed her spaceship and flew to the space station, she sold her Cobalt, Lindsay had forty million Units, she was rich.<br />
After that, the girl flew out of Rochesk Alpha with her spaceship, she flew to the Gears of the Korvax, entering inside its atmosphere.<br />
Then, the girl flew in the direction of trading post number 213, landing her spaceship there, Lindsay then walked inside of it.<br />
She found Ana, Tetracovix, and Zyoox talking there, she sat on an empty chair close to Ana.<br />
Tetracovix and Zyoox said hi to Lindsay, she said hi back, they talked a little.<br />
"We fairies discovered the English language when Ana discovered the underground laboratory.<br />
Ana said that she couldn't understand what the boy said, so she had to hold her necklace to understand it.<br />
Now, with the help of the necklaces, the historian fairies could translate English into our native language, we started learning English in schools," explained Lindsay.<br />
"Oh, that's very interesting, we Korvax have a device in our electronic brain, it can translate other languages into something we can understand.<br />
That's why we can understand what you two say, this device is like the necklaces you can hold to understand English," said Tetracovix.<br />
"Oh, I would like to have that, hehe, but I have my necklace, so it's okay," said Lindsay.<br />
"It's very good to understand your past and history right?" asked Ana.<br />
"Yeah, hehe, we Korvax have a database to where we can connect to know about the history of the universe and the history of the Korvax," replied Zyoox.<br />
"Oh, and where does that database stay?" asked Lindsay.<br />
"It stays on every space station of every galaxy, so if a database fails, there's always another one to fix it.<br />
And we have a device that can store the database inside it, so we do not need to rely on the database of the space station.<br />
We can also download the entire database to our brains, so we do not need to connect to the database," replied Zyoox.<br />
"That's very interesting, hehe," said Ana.<br />
<br />
Then, they continued talking for a while, after that, Ana and Lindsay said bye to the two, they said bye back.<br />
Ana and Lindsay walked out of the trading post, walking to their spaceships.<br />
They began flying, they flew out of the Korvax planet and had gone back to Earth.<br />
While flying, Ana could talk with Lindsay using the microphone and radio of the spaceship.<br />
Ana said that Petra, the explorer fairy who Ana taught how to drive, was on the Korvax planet.<br />
"Oh, I remember seeing a fairy there, I thought it was weird," said Lindsay through the radio.<br />
"Hey, sis, are you proud of me?" asked Ana.<br />
"Yeah, of course, I am, hehe, you're very skillful and have a lot of knowledge, you have discovered a lot of things.<br />
About survival, technologies, the universe, spaceships, Units, our past, the ancient humans.<br />
You'll sure appear in history books as the great discoverer fairy, hehe," replied Lindsay through the radio, smiling.<br />
"Oh, thanks sis, hehe, thank you for all those compliments," said Ana, smiling.<br />
Ana discovered the secret of the crystals, the planets, galaxies, the universe, spaceships, multi-tools, Exo suits, the Korvax, Gek, the past, the history, and the ancient humans.<br />
The historian fairies would have a lot of work to write a new book that would tell the story of Ana, the discoverer fairy.<br />
Lindsay and Ana arrived at Earth, they entered inside the atmosphere, after that, they landed the spaceships on the hut.<br />
They both got out of the spaceships, "Hey, you guys arrived!" said Panda, smiling.<br />
She hugged Ana and Lindsay, they hugged her back.<br />
"This is a very beautiful spaceship, sis, is it yours?" asked Panda, looking at the Alpha Vector with red details.<br />
"Yes, I bought it for me, Lindsay helped me earn the Units to buy it, hehe," replied Ana, looking at Lindsay.<br />
Then they walked inside the hut, it was late afternoon, almost night.<br />
Jena had already made dinner, Ana and Lindsay walked to their bedrooms, removing their Exo suits.<br />
The family ate dinner together, it was some roasted vegetables with some spices and salt, they ate with while drinking lemon juice.<br />
It was delicious, after eating dinner, the family sat on the area chairs of the beach, relaxing, feeling the cold wind and looking at the big moon, lighting up the breathing ocean.<br />
After relaxing for some minutes, they could already sleep because the food was a little processed, they walked back to the hut and walked to their bedrooms, laying on the bed and sleeping.

		Ana awoke on the bed of her bedroom, she did her morning needs and walked to the kitchen.<br />
Lindsay had already made breakfast, Jena and Panda woke up, they also did their morning needs.<br />
The whole family sat at the table to eat, it was some bread with some vegetables, and also milk, it was delicious.<br />
After that, they walked to the beach and sat on area chairs, waiting for the food to be processed, it was good to relax in the shade.<br />
Then, Ana thought about going to an island to practice her survival skills, she told that to Jena, her mother.<br />
Lindsay said she wanted to go too, Panda said she was going to stay at the island, playing, and helping Jena in her job.<br />
Ana and Lindsay walked to the bedrooms, they wore a backpack and grabbed some notepads.<br />
Then, both of them walked out of the hut, walking to the beach, Jena and Panda were there in the shade.<br />
They said bye to Jena and Panda, Ana began flying high, Lindsay followed her.<br />
Ana began flying to an island that she did not visit yet, and did not build primitive things.<br />
After some time of flying, both of them arrived there and landed on the coast of the island.<br />
"Hey, what do you think we need first, little sis?" asked Lindsay, looking at Ana.<br />
"I think we need an ax first, so we can cut some trees," replied Ana.<br />
Lindsay looked for a stone that was good to use as the ax blade, a rectangular stone.<br />
Ana looked for a sharp stone, she found one and grabbed a big stone, soaking it with water from the ocean.<br />
The girl started sharpening the stone, Lindsay had already found a rectangular stone.<br />
Ana got up and grabbed a thick tree branch, she started hitting a tree with the sharp stone that was like a knife.<br />
Lindsay walked to the big stone and sat on the ground, she began sharpening the stone that was going to be the ax blade.<br />
After some time, Ana finished cutting the tree, she walked to where Lindsay was and cut the tree in half.<br />
Lindsay grabbed the half log that was going to be the ax handle, she made a hole in it with Ana's sharp stone.<br />
Ana then grabbed the ax handle and placed the rectangular sharp stone in it, hitting it with the thick tree branch.<br />
"Done!" said Ana, smiling.<br />
"Hehe, we're good," said Lindsay.<br />
<br />
After that, they thought about making some mud cups, a mud jar, and also a furnace.<br />
Lindsay grabbed the ax and began cutting some logs for the fire.<br />
Ana grabbed some water from the ocean with her hands, she walked to a small lake in the forest of the island.<br />
Then she threw the water on the dirt, making some mud, she grabbed the big stone from the beach and brought it to the forest.<br />
Lindsay grabbed some leaves and sticks and started to make some fire in the forest, close to where Ana was.<br />
Ana made two cups of mud and one jar, Lindsay had already finished the fire, Ana placed the things close to the fire.<br />
After waiting for some time, the cups and jar were already dry, Ana made a big bucket of mud to gather some water.<br />
She also placed it close to the fire and waited for it to dry, then she grabbed it and walked to the beach, grabbing some water.<br />
Ana then walked back to the big stone, she sat on the ground and threw the water on the dirt, making some mud.<br />
The girl started making mud bricks to make the furnace.<br />
"While you do that, I'm gonna make a spear to catch some fish and also fill the jar with water," said Lindsay.<br />
"Okay sis," said Ana, smiling.<br />
"I just want to ask you, do you still have that yellow crystal that Tetracovix gave to you?" asked Lindsay.<br />
"Yeah, I always carry it with me, I don't know when I'll need it, so I like to have it with me all the time," replied Ana, who held her necklace, the yellow crystal appeared.<br />
"Oh, okay," said Lindsay, who got up and walked to a tree with the ax, she began to cut it.<br />
Ana finished making some mud bricks, she left them close to the fire to dry.<br />
After that, Lindsay finished cutting the tree, she grabbed the stone knife and began sharpening the log to put a sharp stone on the tip.<br />
Ana saw that Lindsay was a little busy, she grabbed the mud jar and walked to the ocean, filling it with water.<br />
She got back to the fire and left the jar close to it for the water to boil.<br />
Lindsay finished sharpening the log, she looked for a small stone to use as the spear blade, she found one.<br />
The girl grabbed the mud bucket and filled it with water, she sat close to the big stone and put some water in it, then began sharpening the small stone.<br />
Ana moved the jar away from the fire because the water was boiling, she filled the two cups with water and left the cup of Lindsay close to her.<br />
"Thanks, little sis," said Lindsay, smiling.<br />
"No problem, hehe," said Ana, smiling too.<br />
<br />
Then Ana grabbed the mud bricks, she walked to a place in the woods, making a furnace.<br />
Ana grabbed some sticks, leaves, and logs, she made some fire inside the furnace, to dry the bricks.<br />
Lindsay had finished making the spear, she walked to the ocean and caught two fish.<br />
The girl came back to the forest, Ana had finished making the furnace.<br />
Lindsay had a lot of knowledge about plants and nature, she left the two fish on the big stone.<br />
Then she looked around the forest for some plants, she wanted to find some spices.<br />
While looking around, Lindsay found basil, bay leaf, chives, nutmeg, oregano, and paprika.<br />
Lindsay then skinned the fishes, removed their scales, thorns, and bones.<br />
She seasoned them with the spices she found, it looked delicious.<br />
The girl grabbed three sticks, made a skewer on top of the furnace, and placed both fishes on it.<br />
The fish began cooking, Ana was liking the smell.<br />
Ana drank a little of her water, Lindsay too, the two sat close to the furnace, waiting for the fish to cook, Lindsay flew above the trees, looking at the ocean.<br />
Then, Ana heard something on the water, she felt something weird, the ocean waves were weird and heavy.<br />
Suddenly, a big whale jumped out of the water and crossed the island, jumping above and around it, it moaned sadly.<br />
Ana was scared, Lindsay looked at the whale, it had golden scales, looked like metal, and had a crystal on its blowhole, it tried to eat Lindsay, who was flying.<br />
After that, the whale entered inside the water again, it swam back to the right of the island and jumped out of the water again, trying to eat Lindsay, she dodged it.<br />
"I've never seen a whale jump so high like that, we're in danger sis!" said Ana.<br />
"Yeah!" said Lindsay.<br />
Then the whale entered inside the water, it jumped out again, Ana held her necklace and tried to move the whale away with her telekinesis magic.<br />
Ana thought that they stole the food of the whale, that is why it is angry like that.<br />
The girl managed to move the whale to the left, throwing it into the water again.<br />
After that, the fish finished cooking, Lindsay landed on the sand, grabbed a big stone, and removed the fish out of the stick, placing them on the stone.<br />
The whale jumped out of the water again, caught Ana with its mouth, and then entered inside the water again.<br />
"Ana!" shouted Lindsay, worried with her sister.<br />
<br />
Ana was inside the golden whale, it did not try to chomp on her, Ana found that weird.<br />
She was inside the stomach of the whale, it was very big, bigger than it looked from the outside.<br />
Its inside was illuminated with yellow lights, and the walls of the whale were made of gold mixed with skin.<br />
Ana heard the whale singing, she held her necklace and understood what the whale was singing.<br />
It was asking for help to rescue their child, it said that it was on an island with some weird creatures trying to feed on it.<br />
Lindsay flew above the water, looking at the fish inside the ocean, trying to save Ana.<br />
Ana told the whale that she was going to help it rescue its child, the whale started swimming to said island.<br />
After some time swimming, the whale arrived at the island, it jumped on the sand and opened its mouth so Ana could get out.<br />
Lindsay landed on the sand, "Sis, you're okay..." said her, worried.<br />
"Yeah, I'm okay, but we have to be quiet, this golden whale told me that her child is here and she wants me to rescue it," said Ana.<br />
"Oh, okay," said Lindsay, the whale came back to the water, she began swimming around the island.<br />
Ana and Lindsay walked deeper into the island, they held their necklaces and got invisible, a blue sphere of light surrounded Ana, a yellow one surrounded Lindsay.<br />
They continued walking into the forest, after that, they found two ancient humans doing something, there were some wooden boxes around the place.<br />
There was also a shack there, the two girls looked around the place, they saw a small golden whale on a water bucket, jumping a little, the two heard the big whale moan.<br />
"Fish? What you gonna do with the fish, Mark?" asked a man, the two girls held their necklaces to understand the English that the men were speaking.<br />
"I don't know, maybe sell it?<br />
I don't know what happened to the world outside, but we managed to survive in here, thank God," replied the man who probably was Mark.<br />
"Well, I don't know if there's a world for us to return to, maybe they died in a war, or got extinct by themselves, humans are like that," said the other man.<br />
"We got our boat fixed, we could try to explore the world, and, about this fish, what if we ate it, John?" asked Mark.<br />
"Ate it? You want to eat a rare thing such as this one?" asked the other man, who was John.<br />
"Well, no, maybe put it into an aquarium, for showcasing purposes," said Mark.<br />
"I agree," said John.<br />
Ana then held her necklace, she summoned the yellow crystal and grabbed it in her hand.<br />
She got up and unmade her invisibility, pointing the crystal at the two ancient humans, "Release that fish, now!" said Ana.<br />
There was a yellow flower on the tip of the yellow crystal, the top was open, the crystal began spinning on its axis, making a noise.<br />
"Who are you? And why do you want us to release this fish?<br />
You have wings... You're not a human right?" asked Mark.<br />
"No, I'm a fairy, and I want you to release this fish because it's the child of a big golden whale," replied Ana.<br />
"Oh, and what if we don't want? You'll hurt us with that small crystal?" asked John, laughing a little.<br />
Then Ana moved her hand and aimed at a tree, she held the yellow crystal and moved her hand again, cutting the tree with a yellow laser.<br />
<br />
"O-Oh... Okay, sorry..." said Mark, a little scared by the laser.<br />
"Don't be sorry Mark! I want this fish!" said John, who grabbed a spear and threw it at Ana.<br />
Ana held the yellow crystal and grabbed the spear, turning it and throwing it close to John, cutting some of his hair, but not hurting him.<br />
"I'm not gonna let you greedy humans destroy the world again, and do bad things to animals!" said Ana with an angry face.<br />
"B-But we're not gonna hurt the fish, or eat it, we just want to put it in an aquarium," said John.<br />
"Forget it, John, we don't need that to survive," said Mark.<br />
"And how you'll feed it? With berries and apples? You don't have the technology to make glass yet.<br />
This fish needs to live in the ocean, with its mother and other fishes.<br />
You can catch other fish, two men aren't enough to extinguish the entire ocean.<br />
But this golden whale is rare," said Ana.<br />
Lindsay deactivated her invisibility, she got up, "Yeah, I agree with her, she's my sister," said her.<br />
"There's two of them?" asked John, surprised.<br />
"Release the fish!" said Lindsay.<br />
"Okay, okay, fine, we'll release the fish, sheesh," said John, who grabbed the bucket with the fish.<br />
He walked close to Ana, she made a yellow shield around her and Lindsay with the yellow crystal.<br />
John left the bucket close to Ana and Lindsay, he walked back to his camp.<br />
"And thanks for the free log," said John, who had his back to Ana and Lindsay, looking back, he walked close to the tree that Ana cut with the yellow laser.<br />
Mark walked close to the duo, "I apologize for John, he is a little greedy, and likes to showcase things, he is an artist, but he haves a good heart," said Mark.<br />
"Oh, no, it's okay," said Lindsay.<br />
Ana grabbed the bucket and walked to the beach, she threw the fish on the ocean, it swam back to his mother.<br />
The big golden whale swam close to the shore of the island, Ana caressed her head, the whale said thanks and gave a happy moan.<br />
Ana was happy to help the mother, she walked to where Lindsay was.<br />
"So, you're fairies right?" asked Mark, John was cooking other fish that they caught.<br />
"Yeah," replied Ana.<br />
"Do you know what happened to the world outside this island?<br />
Before shipwrecking here, I heard about some experiments in creating new races that the humans were doing, I heard that on the cruise.<br />
You're one of them, right?" asked Mark.<br />
"Yes, well, the majority of the human race got extinguished by itself, through wars and nuclear bombs, that's why we fairies call them ancient humans.<br />
And yes, we're one of them, there's also the Kódeks, Soul Wasps, and Stone Ogres.<br />
They warmed the Earth's surface too much with polluting chemicals, and also died because of power and greed," replied Ana.<br />
"Yeah, and we don't speak English, that is what you're speaking right now, we speak fairy language.<br />
But we can understand English and make our words come out in English because of our magical necklaces," said Lindsay.<br />
"Oh, really?<br />
Can you talk a little in fairy language for me to hear?" asked Mark.<br />
Then the fairies talked in their language, Mark did not understand a thing, but he was intrigued.<br />
"It sounds a little like Japanese," said Mark.<br />
<br />
"So, I'm gonna go back to doing some survival stuff here at the island, or else John will get angry at me, hehe," said Mark, smiling.<br />
"Okay, thanks for releasing the little whale," said Ana, smiling.<br />
"No problem, hehe," said Mark, who got back to his camp.<br />
Then Ana closed the yellow crystal, she deactivated it.<br />
"They were pretty peaceful, right?" asked Lindsay, looking at Ana.<br />
"Yeah, hehe, it was cool to talk with other ancient humans besides Tom.<br />
We gotta tell that to the historian fairies, that not all humans were gone extinct by themselves by the great war," said Ana.<br />
"Yeah, hehe, so, let's go back home or go back to that island?" asked Lindsay.<br />
"Well, the island, we didn't eat the fish yet, right?" asked Ana, who laughed a little.<br />
"Oh, yeah, hehe," said Lindsay, it was afternoon.<br />
The two girls flew high on the sky, above the island, Ana summoned the yellow crystal, she held it.<br />
"Hey sis, I wanna test something," said Ana, who held the yellow crystal, it morphed into the shape of a turbine.<br />
Then she moved the yellow crystal behind the two and activated it, the two fairies made a pulse jump and arrived at the island in a second.<br />
"Wow, this was fast sis, how did you do that?" asked Lindsay.<br />
"I just thought about traveling faster to the island, and the crystal turned into a crystal turbine, so I placed it behind us and activated it," replied Ana.<br />
"Oh, that's cool, hehe," said Lindsay, the two fairies landed on the island.<br />
They sat close to the big stone which was like a table and ate the fish, it was delicious.<br />
After that, Ana set a waypoint at the island with her necklace, she called it "Island close to the two ancient humans, Mark and John".<br />
Ana grabbed the yellow crystal again and made an invisible arrow at the shore of the island, pointing to the island where the ancient humans were.<br />
Only Ana and Lindsay could see that arrow, the two fairies flew high in the sky and started flying back to the Crystal Lands, their home.

		After flying for a while, Ana and Lindsay arrived at the Crystal Lands, they landed on the beach.<br />
It was almost night, Jena and Panda were there, they asked where they have gone.<br />
"We've gone to an island that we never explored," replied Ana.<br />
"And we met two ancient humans, we also met a golden whale.<br />
The golden whale asked Ana for help to rescue her child from the two ancient humans, that wanted to sell the small whale or put it into an aquarium.<br />
So we told them to release the fish, Ana used the yellow crystal to intimidate the ancient humans.<br />
They released the whale, we talked a little, they were very friendly," said Lindsay.<br />
"Oh, that's very interesting my dears, I think you two could tell that story to the historian fairies," said Jena.<br />
"Okay mom, we'll tell," said Ana, the four fairies walked back to their hut, Jena prepared dinner.<br />
The family ate together, it was delicious, after that, Ana and Lindsay walked to the hall of the city.<br />
Both of them entered inside the library, there were some historian fairies there.<br />
"Oh, it's Ana and Lindsay," said one historian fairy, she was sitting on a chair while reading a book, she had a pencil in her hand.<br />
"Hey guys, we have a story to tell to you," said Ana.<br />
"And which one is it?" asked a historian fairy.<br />
Then Ana and Lindsay told them the story of the two ancient humans, Mark and John.<br />
They said that the ancient humans were on a cruise and shipwrecked on the island.<br />
Lindsay and Ana told the historian fairies the location of the island where the ancient humans live.<br />
And said that they were peaceful, Ana told them to say that they are friends with her and Lindsay, so the ancient humans know that they are friendly.<br />
The two said that there probably are more ancient humans on the unexplored islands.<br />
A historian fairy told Ana to tell that to her mother, so she can send a group of explorer fairies to the unexplored islands.<br />
After that, the historian fairies started writing the story on draft sheets, after they revise them, they were going to put them in the history books.<br />
The historian fairies thanked them, the two girls walked out of the library, they walked back to the hut.<br />
Both walked to their bedrooms and laid on their beds, they slept.<br />
<br />
After sleeping for some hours, they woke up, it was morning.<br />
Ana got up and wore her Exo suit, the current date was written on the visor of the Exo suit.<br />
It was 2052, on the fifteenth of September, she grabbed a notepad and a pencil from her backpack, and wrote the current date.<br />
Ana started writing what she did on the notepad, like a diary, she removed her Exo suit and left it in a corner of the bedroom.<br />
She walked to the kitchen, Lindsay already awoke, she was preparing breakfast, Ana started washing the dishes, then she helped Lindsay a little.<br />
They finished making breakfast, the two ate, after that, Jena and Panda woke up, they ate together.<br />
"Hey sis, we're going to the beach to rest a little okay? Come when you're ready," asked Lindsay.<br />
"Okay sis," replied Ana, Panda, and Lindsay walked to the beach.<br />
Ana told her mother to send a group of explorer fairies to the unexplored islands, Jena said ok.<br />
Then, Ana summoned the yellow crystal, she held it and closed her eyes, the girl thought about the explorer fairies and the island with the two ancient humans.<br />
She thought about letting the explorer fairies see the invisible arrow that pointed to the island of the ancient humans.<br />
The girl had a vision of the arrow becoming visible for the explorer fairies.<br />
After that, she deactivated the yellow crystal and walked to the beach to relax with her sisters on the area chairs.<br />
Lindsay and Panda were there, Ana sat on an area chair close to them.<br />
There was a fairy who was playing banjo on the beach, the three sisters were in the shade of a palm tree.<br />
The fairy was a girl, she had blond hair and was wearing a leaf skirt.<br />
It was good to listen to the calm song that the fairy was playing on the banjo, some fairy kids danced along with the music.<br />
After some time relaxing, the trio got up, they walked to the city hall, Jena was there, talking with some explorer fairies.<br />
Ana walked close to her mother, "Hey my dear, can you tell the location of the island with the ancient humans?" asked Jena.<br />
"Sure mom, hold your necklaces," said Ana, who looked at the explorer fairies, Ana held her necklace and closed her eyes, she shared the location of the island with the explorer fairies.<br />
After that, the fairies thanked Ana, they flew high and started flying to the island with the ancient humans.<br />
"The explorer fairies fly so fast," said Ana, looking at the sky.<br />
"Well, they are trained for that, to dodge danger and to explore fast, they can fly just as fast as we flew with the crystal turbine," said Lindsay.<br />
"Yeah, hehe, and as fast as the spaceships," said Ana.<br />
"Thanks, my dear," said Jena.<br />
"No problem, mom," said Ana, smiling.<br />
<br />
After that, Ana thought about paying a visit to Tetracovix, Panda and Lindsay wanted to go too, they said that to Jena.<br />
"Take care of your sisters, Ana," said Jena.<br />
"Okay mom, I'll do," said Ana, smiling, it was afternoon.<br />
They walked to the hut and wore their Exo suits, they also grabbed their multi-tools.<br />
The trio got inside their spaceships, they turned them on.<br />
Tom, the ancient human that Ana met, was there on the beach of the island, the fairy who was taking care of him too.<br />
The boy, or man, waved goodbye to Ana and her sisters, she waved goodbye back.<br />
After that, the trio lifted off the spaceships, pointed the spaceships up, and pushed the accelerator, getting out of the planet.<br />
Tom got back to the hut of his caretaker, her too, she said that Tom was old enough to be able to live alone and that he already learned the way of fairy life.<br />
"But I want to live with you, mom," said Tom to his caretaker, which was called Rosa.<br />
"Aww, hehe, you can live with me then, Tom, as long as you help me with the chores," said Rosa, smiling, who hugged him.<br />
"Of course, I'll help you!" said Tom, smiling back.<br />
Rosa did not have children, and she lived alone in her hut, she was observing the beach when Tom arrived there with Ana.<br />
Ana said that he needed to stay with someone, something appeared in Rosa's heart, and she wanted to take care of Tom because she was feeling lonely.<br />
The days passed, Tom did not need so much care, he could make food and take care of himself, but Rosa was happy that she had some company.<br />
He always goes to the fairy school, and has breakfast before that, he says bye to his caretaker, or mother before going to school.<br />
Rosa is happy because she haves the company of Tom.<br />
<br />
Ana and her sisters arrived on the Gears of the Korvax planet, they flew around it.<br />
Then, they landed their spaceships on the landing pads of the trading post number two hundred thirteen.<br />
Lindsay and the other two got out of their spaceships, they walked inside of the trading post, walking to the living room.<br />
They said hi to Tetracovix and Zyoox, the two said hi back, they sat on three empty chairs, Zyoox was using a holographic screen.<br />
Ana told what she has been doing, and what she discovered about the history of her planet, the origins of it, and the two ancient humans on the island.<br />
"That's very interesting, hehe, I heard about a Korvax colony that created a mechanical planet.<br />
Some kind of nuclear fusion happens in its core, and it keeps the planet rotating, it can rotate even faster than other planets.<br />
They can fly with the planet and control it, fly with a planet!" said Tetracovix.<br />
"Wow, that's very interesting and weird, hehe," said Ana.<br />
"The Korvax are really technological right?" asked Panda.<br />
"Yeah, we are, we can teach you guys about technology if you want, how to make it, and what components to use.<br />
We can even teach you guys how gravity works, the reactions of the universe, elements, atoms," said Tetracovix.<br />
"Oh, that would be awesome, hehe, I think it would be good for us to bring some teacher fairies to learn about that.<br />
So they can teach that to the fairies on school, hehe," said Ana.<br />
"Yeah, that's a very good idea, sis, hehe.<br />
They'll have to organize themselves after that because they have a lot to teach.<br />
About the past, ancient humans, the great war, the species, English language, the space and exploration of it, the universe, the Greent liquid.<br />
And now about technology, hehe," said Lindsay, who giggled a little.<br />
"Yeah, hehe," said Panda.<br />
"Oh, okay, you guys can message me or Zyoox on the Exo suit, there is a system to add friends," said Tetracovix.<br />
"Can you teach us how to use it?" asked Ana.<br />
"Yes, hehe," replied Tetracovix.<br />
Then he taught the trio how to use the messaging system of the Exo suit and the spaceship.<br />
"But... Why we're gonna use it?" asked Panda.<br />
"It's for your next visit if you want to bring teacher fairies.<br />
If you guys are gonna bring them, you can tell us so using the messaging system, for us to prepare ourselves, hehe," replied Tetracovix.<br />
"Oh, okay, thanks Tetra," said Ana.<br />
"No problem, Ana," said Tetracovix.<br />
<br />
It was late afternoon, the three sisters said bye to Tetracovix and Zyoox, they got out of the trading post and got back to their spaceships.<br />
The trio flew back to Earth, they entered inside the atmosphere and flew to the Crystal Lands.<br />
After that, they landed their spaceships close to the hut.<br />
Tom was sleeping in his bedroom, he was light sleeping.<br />
He got up, and got out of the hut, walking to Ana's hut.<br />
The girls were out of the spaceships, Lindsay and Panda were close to the door.<br />
"Heey, Ana," said Tom, a little far, talking a little low to not wake up any fairies.<br />
"Come in, I'll be there in a minute," said Ana to her sisters, they entered inside the hut.<br />
"Hey, Tom," said Ana.<br />
"Can I... Go with you on those survival trips?" asked him.<br />
"Yeah, you can, hehe, you know how to do survival stuff?" asked Ana, smiling.<br />
"I don't know, I just know how to cook, farm plants, and milk cows.<br />
If you want to teach me I'll be happy to learn, but if not, then it's okay, hehe," replied Tom, smiling.<br />
"Oh, no, it's okay, I want to teach you," said Ana, smiling back.<br />
"Okay, thanks Ana, hehe, it's agreed then, right?" asked Tom.<br />
"Yeah, and no problem, hehe," replied Ana, who shook Tom's hand, he shook her hand back.<br />
"So, good night, Ana," said Tom, smiling.<br />
"Good night, Tom," said Ana, smiling back.<br />
Then Tom got back to his hut, Ana too, they both laid on the beds of their bedrooms to sleep.<br />
The two and Ana's sisters slept on a cool night.
